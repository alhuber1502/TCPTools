<LETTER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>OOD Sir, and courteous freinde,
&s;ince the tyme of my late de&EOLhyphen;liuery
from captiuitie, I haue
often called to mynde, hovv de&EOLhyphen;&s;irous
I founde you, to vnder&EOLhyphen;&s;tand
the truthe of our intentio&cmbmacr;,
thoughe litle doubtfull of the
iu&s;tne&s;&s;e of our cau&s;e: but &s;eing the &s;u&s;pitious
Iealou&s;y of guilty con&s;cyences, permitted not &s;uch
conuer&s;ation as accordeth vvith humaine curte&s;y:
and that free &s;peach is theare &s;o fatr intolerable,
that men are examyned by torture, not ouly of
there indifferent vvoordes, but euen of their very
thoughtes, and future actions, I vvi&s;hed oportuni&EOLhyphen;tie
to giue you &s;atisfaction, but v&s;ed &s;ilence, to
auoyde your trooble.</P>
<P>Well, &s;eing it hathe &s;ince plea&s;ed God, to lend
me lyf, liberty, and meanes to &s;end vnto you
(vvhich in &s;o dangerous and vvatchfull a vvorld is
mo&s;te difficill to be founde) I could not omitt to
vvrite at this pre&s;ent, vvhereby your &s;elf, and &s;uch
others, as to vvhome you may vvith &s;afty commu&EOLhyphen;nicate
it, may be the better &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>It is to you very apparent, and vvel knovvne to
the vvhole vvorld, hovv it hathe of late plea&s;ed
God, to di&s;po&s;e of mens actions, according to his
ovvne plea&s;ure: vvhich vve vvill rather accepte as a
puni&s;hment for our &s;innes, then take for a di&s;cou&EOLhyphen;ragement
<PB N="4" REF="3">
to our cau&s;e. Neither can our eni&EOLunhyphen;myes
therein, receaue any occa&s;ion to be the more
in&s;olent, or to glory, in that they de&s;erue not, &s;ithe
theire valour, neuer made our enterpri&s;e fru&s;trate:
them&s;elues confe&s;&s;ing, it vvas not donne by the
pui&s;ance of man, but by the povver of God: vvhich
they let not to &s;ay, may giue &s;ufficient proof of
their cau&s;e: not &s;eeming to remember, hovv &s;undry
examples can giue te&s;timony, of diuers attempts
misfortuned at the fir&s;t, that aftervvard haue &s;ucce&EOLhyphen;ded

of I&s;raell is the mo&s;te notable: They being

great foile and confu&s;ion of there enimyes. And
to giue you an example neerer home, you may
reade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Polid. Vir&EOLhyphen;gil.</NOTE> hovv the expedition that <HI>Iulius Cea&s;er</HI> made
into England, not for that the Britaines had a&s;&s;i&s;ted
his rebells robbed his trea&s;ure, or entruded them&EOLhyphen;&s;elues
into his dominions: but only for that they
had aydid the frenche, vvhen he made vvar
again&s;t them: came at the fir&s;t to no effect, yet
vvere tho&s;e Britaines no vvhit the more a&s;&s;ured of
&s;ecuritie, for the yeare follovving he returned agai&EOLhyphen;ne,
and gat the victorie.</P>
<P>God hathe puni&s;hed vs for our &s;innes vvhich are
great, but the puni&s;hment of our faultes, excu&EOLhyphen;&s;eth
not your far greater offences, your &s;uperiours
mu&s;t vvel knovve they haue de&s;erued a plague, and
their guilty con&s;ciences greatly feare to fynde it,

way to ouerthrowe there de&s;ignementes, then a

<P>Vaine are tho&s;e per&s;ua&s;ions of theirs, that our
lo&s;&s;es are irrecouerable, and that there remaineth
for vs, neither hope nor comforte. Which yf it were
&s;o, yet are not they freed from de&s;erued vengeance,
and that it is not &s;o, a litle tyme can make mani&EOLhyphen;fe&s;t.
Such &s;peaches only argue, that they haue ma&EOLhyphen;de
a re&s;olution to run on in all impiety, and to trie
to the vttermo&s;te, vvhether Gods pui&s;ance or
their vngodly practi&s;es can mo&s;te preuaile: vvhere
in they &s;hall vvell fynde, that he can many wayes
confounde the vvicked, vvhen them&s;elues &s;hall
no vvay preuent it. Meane vvhyle, there outvvarde
courage is mixte vvith invvarde care, and there
fayned Ioy vvith re&s;tle&s;&s;e iealou&s;y: vvho in &s;eeming
to feare nothing, are &s;eene to &s;tart at their ovvne
&s;hadovves.</P>
<P>This intolerable feare is more manife&s;ted in
your Engli&s;he Gouernment, then in any &s;tate els in
the vvhole vvorld: the great impre&s;&s;ion thereof
enforcing them, to all their &s;pyings abroade, and
inqui&s;itions at home: &s;earchings of hou&s;es more
at midnighte then at noone dayes, apprehen&s;ions,
examinations, and &s;uch daily exerci&s;e, and practi&s;e
of the racke,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="&lang;&hellip;&rang;"></NOTE> as neuer the like vvas hard of: &s;till fyn&EOLhyphen;ding

only able to confe&s;&s;e no more, then that vvhich co&cmbmacr;&EOLhyphen;cerneth
their ovvne religion and con&s;cience: not&EOLhyphen;vvith&s;tanding
all vvhich, the remedies remaining
(rather to patche vp the &s;tate of a body &s;o far in&EOLhyphen;fected,
then to cure an incurable di&s;ea&s;e) are prin&EOLhyphen;cipally
<PB N="6" REF="4">
grounded, vpon extreme tyranny, and
deepe di&s;&s;imulation.</P>
<P>Their tyranny is chiefly extended, to the Catho&EOLhyphen;liques
of your owne country, of whome very many
before, and &s;undry &s;ince our di&s;a&s;tre, they haue
cruelly executed: and by fal&s;e lying libells after
there deathes, haue &s;oughte to in&s;inuate that they
vvere of con&s;piracie vvith vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="&lang;&hellip;&rang;"></NOTE> albeit it plea&s;ed God
to di&s;couer this their great iniu&s;tice, euen in the
very execution thereof, for tvvo of that nomber
vvich vvere nexte after condemned to deathe for
trea&s;on, conde&s;cending throughe frailty, to recant
their religion, vvere forthvvith pardoned, and re&EOLhyphen;&s;tored
to libertie. Which benefyte of lyf, all the
others mighte a&s;well and as ea&s;ely haue enioyed as
they, yf the grace of God, had not in them bin the
greater. Which euidently argueth for vvhat cau&s;e
they vvere condemned, &s;ince recantation from
trea&s;on, after or afore condemnation to death, I
neuer knevve could &s;aue a mannes lyf, yf him&EOLhyphen;&s;elf
li&s;t.</P>
<P>Touching their di&s;&s;imulation, being the groun&EOLhyphen;de
and &s;ub&s;tance of their, gouernment, and contey&EOLhyphen;ning
the infynite nombers of deceatfull practi&s;es,
fal&s;e fictions, and &s;launderous lies, vvhich a&s;vvell in
the vvorld abroade, as al&s;o at home, they haue arti&EOLhyphen;ficially
exercy&s;ed, in euery action, is &s;uche a labo&EOLhyphen;rinthe
to looke into, that it vvould rather require
a vvhole volume, then a brief relation. I vvil there
fore leaue the nomber of tho&s;e vnto &s;uch as by
longe experience, haue made better ob&s;eruation
then my &s;elf: &amp; for breuitie only &s;ett dovvne, &s;ome
fevve notable examples of their vntrue &s;peaches,
familiar to your &s;elues, vvherevvith they haue
<PB N="7" REF="4">
foughte to make odious to the people, to calum&EOLhyphen;niate
and condemne, &s;uch as them&s;elues plea&s;ed.
By vvhich fevve you may receaue lighte to looke
into the others, and to giue &s;uch credit to the like
hereafter, as experience hathe prooued, the former
to de&s;erue.</P>
<P>It may therefore plea&s;e yon (amonge many late
rumours of the lyke condition and qualitie) to cal
to remembrance vvhat di&s;pytefull pamphlets,
and odious reportes, vvere bruited again&s;t the late
duke of <HI>Northfolke,</HI> but you may vvel a&s;&s;ure your
&s;elf, that neuer any one man of &s;ence belieued, that
the &s;aid Duke euer intended, to haue fyred <HI>London</HI>
in fovvre places.</P>
<P>You haue hard of images of vvax hidden in the
earthe, vvhereof bothe bookes and ballettes vvere
&s;pred aboute the country, that this vvas don by
Catholiques, to con&s;ume the Queene, and &s;ome

mini&s;ter of I&s;lington vvas apprehended, char&EOLhyphen;ged
that he vvas a Papi&s;t, mo&s;te cruelly racked, and

In tho&s;e particulers whereupon I knovv you

<P><HI>It vvas made a very cleare ca&s;e,</HI> that you &s;hould

<P>To an&s;vvere all which (&s;ince you &s;omtyme vrged

great multytudes, are ouer borne, by the impious
tyranny, of powrable per&s;ons, ontwardly to con&EOLhyphen;de&s;cend

<P>That your goods &s;hould be robbed and taken

that now of late, more then here-tofore, her Maie&EOLhyphen;&s;ties

To the other ridiculous, and friuolous forgeries,

<P><PB N="36" REF="19">AFTER that I had fini&s;hed this my letter,
vnder&s;tanding that throughe defaulte of
wynde, together with &s;ome difficulty that the me&s;&EOLhyphen;&s;enger
put, about his more &s;afe and &s;peedy pa&s;&s;&EOLhyphen;age:
he was not lyke to departe &s;o &s;oone, as him&s;elf
had promi&s;ed, and I expected, I therefore detained
this letter, &s;ome dayes in my handes vn&s;ealed, at&EOLhyphen;tending
&s;uche oportunitie, as mighte neere&s;t con&EOLhyphen;curr
to our de&s;ires.</P>
<P>In the meane &s;ea&s;on, I vnder&s;tood by letters
from <HI>Roan,</HI> that the great and extraordinary en&EOLhyphen;gli&s;he
fleete, furni&s;hed at the charges of &s;o many,
who either of force, or fauour, had &s;treyned them&EOLhyphen;&s;elues
to &s;erue,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="&lang;&hellip;&rang;">.</NOTE> they knew not well whome, where,
nor when: yet now, after long delay, great coun&EOLhyphen;&s;ell,
and corre&s;pondence of freinds, they were de&EOLhyphen;parted,
from the we&s;t parte of England, aboute the
fir&s;t of May, <HI>&s;tilo nouo:</HI> vnder the conduct (by &s;ea)
of the glorious &amp; famous man Sir, <HI>Frauncis Drake,</HI>
who a litle before, had promi&s;ed the Queene his
mi&s;tres, to bring the <HI>Kynge</HI> of <HI>Spaine</HI> to very great
pouerty, and mi&s;ery. And the charge of &s;eruice by
land, was committed to Sir <HI>Iohn Noris,</HI> who&s;e ex&EOLhyphen;perience,
the engli&s;he were woont greatly to mag&EOLhyphen;nify.
The re&s;t of their Captaines, and &s;oldiers, were
the be&s;t that they had: hauing retyred the princi&EOLhyphen;pall
of tho&s;e, from tho&s;e partes of the low coun&EOLhyphen;tries,
which they pre&s;ently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>Very &s;hortly after, I vnder&s;tood by other letters,
from the afore &s;aid place, and the &s;ame party. That
the Engli&s;h were arryued, not very farr from S<hi rend="sup">t</HI>.
<HI>Iames</HI> in <HI>Galitia.</HI> Perhaps with &s;ome intention in
their way, to haue vi&s;ited that place, of e&s;peciall de&EOLhyphen;uotion,
to the riches and ornaments there. Where
<PB N="37" REF="19">
albeit, that very many &s;trangers, from all partes of
<HI>Europe:</HI> according to an old cu&s;tome of chri&s;tians,
do continually come on pilgrimage. And that vnto
&s;uch, the inhabitants thereaboutes do freely giue
leaue, and relief: Yet they now &s;eeing the Engli&s;h
to approche, in a manner muche different from
other pilgrimes, haue accordingly giuen them a
farr other kynde of entertaiment, in&s;omuch (that
as my freind writeth) tho&s;e that lately &s;o arro&EOLhyphen;gantly
boa&s;ted, of &s;ome detrime&cmbmacr;t of ours: which all

&s;eas, which it plea&s;ed God to permitt to our pu&EOLhyphen;ni&s;hment:
Haue now receyued &s;uch a check, for
that in&s;olencie, that they may &s;ee our &s;elues are

<P>Yf you can come by the names of tho&s;e men of

&s;end them ouer, becau&s;e I wold gladly &s;ee, how
our adui&s;es &s;hall differ. The author of the late
pamphlet, printed at <HI>London</HI> in Engli&s;h, &amp; frenche,

I knowe, he will cary a great care, aboute

<P>And wheras in the beginning of that letter, the
