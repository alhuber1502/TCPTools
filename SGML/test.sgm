<HEAD>THE Preface.</HEAD>
<P>THE bu&s;ine&s;s of a Portable Ba|rometer have been the endeavours of &s;everal Men above Thir|ty Years la&s;t pa&s;t: To find out &s;ome way or o|ther to put the Quick|&s;ilver
<PB REF="3">Gla&s;s into a &s;ecure Travelling Po&s;ture: at la&s;t they got a way to tye a piece of Leather over the Ci&s;tern and round the Tube, and &s;uch they called their Por|table Barometers, which the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;|actions</HI> &s;aies, are no ways to be tru&s;ted to, by rea&s;on of their Intole|rable Errors, and be|&s;ides are indeed no ways Portable: which this of mine is to every bo|dy that can but walk,
<PB REF="3">and will whether they will or not &s;hew any alteration of Weather, and &s;everal other things be&s;ides: But this &s;hort Account being altogether new, and I believe the fir&s;t that ever came a|broad of this nature, con&s;i&s;ting only of Expe|riments and Di&s;coveries of this In&s;trument, it will I hope (from friends e&s;pecially) want the le&s;s Apology, both for the Stile, Matter, and manner which is not of|ten
<PB REF="4">&s;o &s;moth well dige&s;t|ed and ordered in a thing that never was before, as it may be a &s;econd time: And I hope the confide|rations of the u&s;efulne&s;s of the&s;e Barometers in all the following and many other Di&s;coveries will excu&s;e the re&s;t, not only in what concerns the true Nature, Quality, Temper and Inclinati|ons of the Air, as to its &s;elf and the alterations of the Weather, but all other Liquids as well

<PB REF="5">conducted from thence to their Prima Materia, and &s;o to the Grand Sy|&s;tem of the Great World.

<P>The Portable Barometer is an In&s;trument that weighs the Air, mea&s;ures its Height, and foretells all the alterations of Weather both in Quantity and Quality, which for the better under&s;tanding it will be convenient to tell the rea&s;ons, which I &s;hall do in ten Particulars, Then &s;hew the man|ner in its u&s;e, and &s;ettle the Rules, for there is no alteration of Wea|ther, which is not preceeded by an alteration of the weight of the Air, both for Heat and Cold, as well as Wet and Dry, which comes to pa&s;s in this manner.</P>
<P>The continual motion of the Parts of Matter, of which all things are compo&s;ed, and from whence they encrea&s;e and decay, begets a mighty Emancipation of Atoms, with con&s;tant Emanations from e|very part of all &s;orts of Bodies, which being pre&s;&s;ed on every &s;ide
<PB N="4" REF="9">by the Univer&s;al Fluid of Air gives them particular bounds, and &s;o con|&s;titute an Atmo&s;phere or Sphere of Attoms to every Body (and is thereby al&s;o the cau&s;e of Electri|cal Attractions) therefore the great Globe of Earth and Water, with all its con&s;i&s;tent Bodies mu&s;t needs have very Copious Effluvi|ums, and &s;o make a very large Atmo&s;phere, being by an Univer|&s;al Motion driven from every part of the whole, as far as the Power of that Motion, and the Pre&s;&s;ure of the Air will give leave, which by that Pre&s;&s;ure and their own weight are again returned like random-&s;hot, from whence they are &s;ent: This Sphere of Atoms (or at lea&s;t our Hemi&s;pherical part thereof) is &s;ometimes filled with more and le&s;s Emanations by the inequality of that Motion &s;everal Undulations, particular Eddies, and the Effluvia Circulations, which in like manner does more or le&s;s keep off the Airs Gravitation whereby a Cylinder of the Air
<PB N="5" REF="9">cannot weigh &s;o much in wet or Winds Weather as it does in dry Weather (and not as <HI>John Smith</HI> tells us by his Principle of Philo|&s;ophy, that the Air is lighter by be|ing mixt with watery vapors, tho a thou&s;and times heavier than its &s;elf, and mixes Water with Rectified Spi|rits of Wine for a Demon&s;tration in his <HI>Horological Di&s;qui&s;itions</HI> pag. 75.) I &s;ay Winds as well as Wet keep off the Airs Gravitati|ons for Winds al&s;o being only humid bodies &s;ufficiently dilated and by that Expan&s;ive force the &s;trugling Atoms as &s;trangely a|gitated, with numerous and powerful Attacks from multi|tudes of fre&s;h Emancipations and Eruptions from our Aeolian Globe mu&s;t needs keep off the Air's Gravitation, much more then o|ther Pacide Vapors (as I &s;hall further Demon&s;trate in the third and fifth Chapters following) which in the Common Barome|ter make very con&s;iderable altera|tions, tho there be no Rain,
<PB N="6" REF="10">and are ea&s;ily di&s;covered by &s;eve|ral Hygro&s;copes by their &s;urpri|&s;ing Gravities, as I &s;hall &s;hew in the tenth Chapter. Thus our Aeo|lian Effluvia do not only keep off the Gravitation of the Air, but are the cau&s;e of the variation of its weight.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>How Rain and Snow are Generated and Produced, and why they make a Cylinder of Air lighter, and yet any other particular parcel of Air much heavier.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHat I have to &s;ay upon the Contents of this Chapter, is not of the prime cau&s;e of Rain and Snow, but only a &s;hort account of their Generation and Production, in relation to their affections of the Atmo&s;phere, for the better under|&s;tanding of the nature and u&s;e of the Barometer. Rain and Snow, then are generated of the &s;ame mat|ter: But for di&s;tinction I will fir&s;t give an account of Rain, and then of Snow. Rain is generated of the Effluviums that con&s;titute our Ter|raqueous Atmo&s;phere, being by their Emancipated motion in a certain
<PB N="8" REF="11">part thereof driven towards the ex|tremity of the Sun's reflections into a cooler Region, they &s;oon con|den&s;e in &s;ome little part fir&s;t, which Conden&s;ation immediately makes room for the natural Ela&s;ticity of the Air, which as &s;oon begins to carry a long with it all the other Effluvia round about to the fir&s;t Conden&s;ation, where being by this Ela&s;tick force, fir&s;t brought from all the neighbouring parts, the Efflu|vious Air then runs down by its own weight and Ela&s;ticity from every &s;ide to a va&s;t extent, where being heaped and crowded toge|ther, they not only fall by their Innate Gravity, but by the &s;ame motion of Air (which now is Wind) are &s;ent down &s;ometimes with ex|tream violence, and thus not only the neighbouring Atoms are con|den&s;ed in a little Cloud and &s;mall Showers, but the whole Hemi&s;phe|rical Effluvia are driven and drawn together and di&s;charged upon a whole Country or national Hori|zon oftentimes, till the whole half Atmo&s;phere is emptied of all tho&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="11">Vapors, and then having made a Current from every part beyond, all the other Emanations that are rai&s;ed in other parts of the world as readily flow hither, to be di&s;|charged here in continual Rains for a long time together, till by a piarticuler Conden&s;ation in &s;ome other Place, the cour&s;e is altered and the Current turned, and then it may be Dry as long; the Con|tinual &s;tream of Atoms being car|ried away to other Places to be di&s;charged there.</P>
<P>The difference between &s;torms or a little wet, and la&s;ting &s;ettled Rains, is that in the fir&s;t Emanci|pated Atoms being not &s;o thick or Copious as at other times in their elevating Motions, become Bounded by Particular Eddies of Air, which drives them &s;o clo&s;e together, that by this means they are formed into Clouds; and by their being driven yet clo&s;er to|gether, by the Power and &s;trength of the&s;e Eddies, and the Addition of fre&s;h Matter: The &s;mall Atoms fall &s;o fa&s;t one into another by
<PB N="10" REF="12">Cold and compre&s;&s;ure that very large Drops are Immediately pro|duced and &s;ent Down with more or le&s;s violence according to the Di&s;po&s;ition of their Motion, the Sea&s;on, and Air.</P>
<P>But in &s;ettled Rains, the Efflu|vious Vapors, having for &s;ome time before been continually filling our Heme&s;phere, from all parts without any di&s;charge, in a &s;till and quiet manner without di|&s;turbing the Air; at la&s;t receive a Conden&s;ation as above in &s;ome particular part, which Immediately makes way for the Airs Ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P>But being now every where filled, which the&s;e Vapors cannot unbend or move &s;o fa&s;t; yet con|tinually brings the Neighbouring Vapors, and &s;o are gently and continually &s;ent down as long as they la&s;t-</P>
<P>Snow is generated of the &s;ame Effluvium's or &s;mall peices of moi|&s;ture when the Sun is at a conveni|ent Di&s;tance, and the Country pro|per with Hills, Mountains, and Latitudes. The Calorifick Beams
<PB N="11" REF="12">being ea&s;ily hindred by them, or not tended far enough for the other, together with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Contrary Motions, or Interpo&s;i|tions of the Beams of the other Stars; or ob&s;tructed by the Nu|merous Effluvia that murales or or walls the whole Atmo&s;phere, or by contrary currants of Air, or Winds: and the Heat being thus or any other ways kept off, and the Effluvious Vapours continuing their Pneumatick Motions, with|out any great pre&s;&s;ure, they are not conden&s;ed into Drops, but are frozen in their own &s;hapes, in &s;ome little part fir&s;t: which is quickly extended to all the re&s;t by the Frigorifick Saline, Particls as they u&s;e to tell us, univer&s;ally di&s;|per&s;ed and mixed with the&s;e A|toms. But rather by the former privations, as will be further de|mon&s;trated in the 6 Chapter. Then being driven a little clo&s;er they fall by their own weight in bigger or le&s;&s;er Flakes, and with more or le&s;s driving according as the Motion, Cold and Pre&s;&s;ure is. Then
<PB N="12" REF="13">as for Hail, that is &s;eldom any o|ther ways than in Storms, and is a kind of half frozen Snow and Rain mixed together. The manner of its generation and Production may be ea&s;ily conceived by the ac|count I have given of Rain and Snow with better &s;atisfaction than what they u&s;e to tell us of the drops freezing after they fall from the Clouds, which is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible. But this being not &s;o directly to my purpo&s;e, I &s;hall &s;ay no more of it, but only demon&s;trate how Rain and Snow which thus thick|ens and fills the Air, yet make a Cylinder thereof much lighter, but any other particular parcel of Air much heavier. The rea&s;on why Snow and Rain make a Cylinder of Air lighter, is that the Effluvious vapours that con&s;titute the Atmo|&s;phere and of which it con&s;i&s;ts, be|ing &s;o very numerous from every part of Matter, and &s;o con&s;tantly and powerfully &s;ent out, that they not only make particular &s;treams from the more fluid parts, but an univer&s;al &s;tream from the whole
<PB N="13" REF="13">Globe of Earth and Water, and all other con&s;i&s;tent Bodies whatever. This univer&s;al &s;tream or flood of Vapors being thus united in all parts of the world, make an intire &s;creen of conden&s;ed or thickened Matter to a great thickne&s;s, being near a thou&s;and times more &s;olid than Air, before they appear in Clouds, and therefore mu&s;t needs keep off or &s;top the Airs penetra|tion, and thereby its Gravitation, which yet does not require a gene|ral Rain or Snow, for a little that comes by particular Currents or Eddies in Storms will do it, for they being of no great height, want no great extent, to hinder both the direct and collateral pre&s;&s;ure of the Air, as has been ob&s;erved by com|mon Barometers in a little di&s;tance. Thus the Ethereal Particles are al|ways hindred by the&s;e Emanati|on, at all times, but much more in wet than in dry weather, and the nearer the Earth's Surface, the more they are ob&s;tructed, as ap|pears in the little heights of &s;mall Hills, by the &s;ame Barometers, &s;o
<PB N="14" REF="14">that it is impo&s;&s;ible a Cylinder of Air &s;hould weigh &s;o much in wet, as it does in dry weather, which I &s;hall now demon&s;trate by Experi|ments al&s;o.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="experiments">
<HEAD>Experiments in weighing the Air.</HEAD>
<P>In weighing the Air with the Portable Barometer the Weights may and do con&s;i&s;t of Ounces, Drachms, Scruples and Grains, and may as well be Pounds, or Hundreds, but will be mo&s;t Con|venient to have them of one De|nomination, and the bigger or more Weights we u&s;e, the greater will be the variation of the &s;maller parts (if the Balance be good) to fore|tell the la&s;t as well as other altera|tions of weather by, which with &s;mall weights except the Balance be very nice, will not be ca&s;ie to di|&s;tingui&s;h &s;o many minute variati|ons as all the alterations of weather will require; I have therefore a weight con&s;i&s;ting of, or divided into 2000 equal parts for the Mid|dle or Center of variation, and
<PB N="15" REF="14">have not yet ob&s;erved the weight of Air to vary full 60 &s;uch parts, either a|bove or below that number, that is 120 in all, &s;o if the weight be bigger the variations will be more, as this of 2000 is 120, if it were 4000, the vari|ation would be 240 &s;uch parts, which is near ten times as much as in the Common Barometer, but if it be but 1000, the variations will not be above 60 &s;uch parts, which is 3 times as much as the common ones, and to be le&s;s will not be &s;o &s;erviable.</P>

<P>The&s;e I believe are &s;ufficient to prove that a Cylinder of Air does not weigh &s;o much in wet as in dry wea|ther, but yet a particular parcel of Air as a Quart, Gallon or Bu&s;hel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> mu&s;t needs weigh much heavier in a wet time or tho only mi&s;ty, then in a clear Sea&s;on, it containing &s;o many watery Particles every where within our reach, that there is not above one third part of pure Air, if &s;o much as I have &s;everal times tried.</P>

<P>Then on the 12th of <HI>Sept.</HI> 1698, when a Cylinder of Air weighed 2025, the Weather Fair, the Aeolipile heat and weighed as before, would now hold but 15 Grains and a half of Air.</P>

<P>THe Portable Barometer, being an In&s;trument that di&s;covers all the alterations of Weather, it will be convenient to give &s;ome account of Winds al&s;o, what they are, and how produced, for they are as well fore|&s;een by this as any other &s;ort of wea|ther, and the rea&s;on we have had no better knowledge of them, is only for want of a true method in Science, to direct us in all natural ob&s;ervations to enlarge and confirm our knowledge, That have kept us from it, therefore what I have to &s;ay of Winds cannot be expected to be either &s;o full or per|fect as what is dilivered of more ob|vious Subjects, being not &s;o Cogni&s;ci|ble to our Sen&s;es, but are indeed of a Metaphy&s;ical Nature, of which few I

<PB N="21" REF="19">E&s;quire <HI>Boyle, Mer&s;ennus</HI> and others have experienced without heat, by removing the Circumjacent Pre&s;&s;ure of the other Aerial Particles, but let this or any &s;uch Rarefaction be pro|duced from what cau&s;e &s;oever, either by the Sun Beams, or any other heat, or Conden&s;ation of &s;ome particular part, to make room for the natural Expan|&s;ion of another, the effects will be all one, a Wind mu&s;t in&s;ue by the Pro|tru&s;ion of other Air, which by this means crowd and Superonerate the former &s;paces, whereby that won|derful and admirable Emotions of the Atmo&s;phere is produced, we call Wind, which is more or le&s;s violent according to the force and extent of the Rarefaction.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Compre&s;&s;ure is another way, by which Winds may be gene|rated, the Effluvious Air being in con|tinual motion, not in one, but &s;everal Currents mu&s;t needs produce very numerous undulations, the&s;e together, almo&s;t as many Eddies, whether in pure Air, Efflvious Vapours, or Clouds, which in contrary Currents meet, with more or le&s;s violence, ac|cording
<PB N="22" REF="20">to the Bigne&s;s, Strength, and Den&s;ity of the Matter, by which means the Wind may (as the pre&s;&s;ure is) vio|lently de&s;cend Perpendicularly to the Earth, or being reverted by cro&s;s or collateral ob&s;tructions, heaping and pre&s;&s;ing Superonerations, makes as vi|olent Whirl-winds, Hurricanes or Tor|nadoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to blow from all the parts of the Compa&s;s at the &s;ame time, with amazing Di&s;plo&s;ions, as if the Heavens and the Earth were going to be torn in pieces, by the&s;e examinating Tem|pe&s;ts. But their &s;everal Species is not my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s, only the u&s;e of the Barometer, but if Life and Lei&s;ure &s;erve, it may be done in another Edi|tion.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Ela&s;ticity the natural &s;prin|gine&s;s of the Air is another cau&s;e of Winds, for tho we &s;uppo&s;e our At|mo&s;phere to be in never &s;o &s;till and quiet a po&s;ture, and all things mo&s;t calm and &s;edate, yet 'tis impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be all of one univer&s;al con&s;i|&s;tency, but mu&s;t contain a great vari|ety of rare and den&s;e parts, from the Local Diffirances the Emanations pro|ceed from, either Waters or Mar&s;hes,
<PB N="23" REF="20">or dry Lands, and the&s;e different de|grees of fluid Den&s;ities, being upon a ju&s;t and true Aequilibrium, a &s;mall &s;trenght of other Ela&s;tick Particles between, turns them any way, which immedi|ately make room for a numerous &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of other Auxiliaries to a va&s;t ex|tent, that carries all before them in an impetuous Wind. So that when|ever any Aereal Particle has leave to unbend it &s;elf in any po&s;ture, it im|mediately gives way to the other neigh|bouring Particles Expan&s;ions, and as the motion is made, to others beyond, to a mighty extent, by which means their &s;trength is al&s;o encrea&s;ed to a mighty proportion, with the additi|on of their weight, to their Ela&s;tici|ty, and &s;o carries all before them to the turning up of the &s;tronge&s;t Oakes or Buildings, which continue till the Ela&s;tick Particles are driven to their utmo&s;t extentions, that the other pacid Particles will yeild to, and then they begin again to curl and fluctuate, and by degrees to &s;ettle in their native po&s;tures, and a quiet calm, till fre&s;h cau&s;es give them new di&s;turbances.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="21">
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The Re&s;ilition of the At|mo&s;phere is another cau&s;e that pro|duces wind, the Effluvious Air being ea&s;ily taken and brought into currents by &s;everal Meanders, as well in the upper as in the lower Regions; in the upper by the Sun Beams, or the parti|cular con&s;titution, or local po&s;ition of the &s;ame Effluviums; and in the lower by the Waters in &s;everal Seas and Channels, and al&s;o with &s;everal Moun|tains and Valleys by Land, this tender fluid being &s;o very tractable, &s;o ea&s;i|ly &s;u&s;ceptible and long retentive of the la&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion, that 'tis a kind of a perpetual Automata, which may by the&s;e or &s;everal other ways be brought into Currents; but yet it is almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible the&s;e Currents &s;hould be con|tinued in even and uninterrupted Or|bicular cour&s;es, but mu&s;t be met or ob&s;tructed by &s;everal Clouds and Den&s;ities in the Atmo&s;phere, Hills, Mountains, the Sun Beams, contrary Currents of Air, Provincial Trade or Ete&s;ian-winds, Ma&s;carets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> any of which ob&s;tructions forthwith be|gets this Re&s;ilition, and that more or le&s;s wind, according to the bigne&s;s
<PB N="25" REF="21">and &s;trength of the recoyling Protru|&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Subterraneal eruptions are another cau&s;e of Winds, which erup|tions are produced by the Calid Emo|tions and Efferve&s;cencies of Mineral Heterogeneities that plentifully abound in all parts of the world; and the&s;e Calid Emotions by the mixtures of the Effluvious Acids from Niter, and o|ther Salts, Vitriols, Sulphurs, Antimo|ny, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which will immediately heat only with a &s;mall quantity of fair water (as Spirits of Niter and Vitriol, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are only their acid &s;alts freed from their more Terre&s;trial parts, and united with a little Phlegm, mingled with water will do) the &s;mall Parti|eles of which are always at hand, and can never be wanting in no &s;uch places. And with bigger additions of other Auxiliaries, are in &s;ome places aug|mented to actual fires, by which means their acid Salts are made Alcaline, and &s;o furni&s;h the whole Univer&s;e with &s;ufficient matter for Efferve&s;cen|cies, and fermenting Calid Emotions by the continual actions and reactions of their Acid and Alcaline Particles,
<PB N="26" REF="22">as quick Lime and Water, or the&s;e with Sal Armoniack, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or any Acid Spirit with the a&s;hes of Wood, Bones, Coals, or other Alcalies will immedi|ately heat and boyl without fire, with &s;uch &s;trength and violence, that the &s;tronge&s;t Ve&s;&s;el cannot contain them. Thus the Subterraneal Caverns are the Kingdom of <HI>Aeolus,</HI> and Nature's Chy|mical Furnaces, where all the nume|rous Cranies are Receptacles of Wind, from the internal Vulcano's. Rarefacti|ons, which are continually &s;ent Night and Day from all tho&s;e places, and con&s;tantly di&s;turb our Atmo&s;phere more or le&s;s, in one place or another, by their powerful Propul&s;ions: For the Earth is the fir&s;t Mother of Meteors, and contains all tho&s;e re&s;tle&s;s Spirits and Efferve&s;cencies, that afterwards rai&s;e Storms, Tempe&s;ts, Hurricanes, and Tornado's by Sea; &s;everal raging Winds and violent Storms by Land, Thunders and Lightnings in the Air, and Earth-quakes under ground, fre|quently known to come from the burn|ing Mountains in <HI>China,</HI> the Grotto's in <HI>Calabria</HI> and <HI>Sicily:</HI> The <HI>Alps</HI> and many other places of the World.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="22">
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Submarine eruptions are produced in the &s;ame manner under the Sea, as the others are under the Ground, and generate Winds as they do, and are called <HI>Procella Coeca,</HI> they break out in a Cloud or Mi&s;t, from un|der the Water, and encrea&s;e and dif|fu&s;e them&s;elves, till they cover the face of the whole Heavens, and end in mo&s;t dreadful Tempe&s;ts, we have an account of one from our Fleet at <HI>Duncannon,</HI> by the Principal Officers to their Superiours in <HI>England,</HI> related by E&s;quire <HI>Boyle,</HI> that in a calm day, there &s;uddenly a&s;cended a black Cloud out of the Water, hard by them, in &s;hape and bigne&s;s of a Barrel, which afterwards ended in &s;o hideous and dreadful a Tempe&s;t, that it forced the Ships to Sea again, in the greate&s;t dan|ger of total de&s;truction, and had like to have ca&s;t them away. So in St. <HI>Owen</HI>'s Bay, in the I&s;le of <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> when never &s;o calm, and no Wind &s;tirring, the&s;e &s;ubmarine Tempe&s;ts often appear, and the roaring of the Waves are heard all over the I&s;le, and 20 or 30 miles in|to <HI>France,</HI> and in the River <HI>Dourdongn</HI> near <HI>Bourdeaux;</HI> the Ma&s;carets &s;well

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>That they are ea&s;ily foretold, becau&s;e they produce the greate&s;t variation in the weight of the Air.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WInds being only the motions or agitations of our Effluvious Air, it may at fir&s;t &s;eem &s;trange how they &s;hould cau&s;e &s;o great an alterati|on in the weight thereof above any o|ther &s;ort of Weather, and will be al|mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee a Cylinder of Air that now weighs 2020, or more, in a few hours, not to weigh above 1970 or le&s;s, and after the Wind is over, in a little longer time, to weigh 2020 a|gain, or more than it did before, til<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> the matter and cau&s;es are con&s;idered&punc; If our Hemi&s;pherical part of the Atmo|&s;phere continue of an even thickne&s;s
<PB N="33" REF="25">and the Effluvia in the &s;ame po&s;ture, a Cylinder of Air mu&s;t needs conti|nue of the &s;ame weight; for as there is nothing to alter its den&s;ity, &s;o 'tis impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould alter its gravity, and continuing of the &s;ame weight, the Effluvia are neither di&s;per&s;ed, nor more heaped or crowded together, therefore being &s;till there can be no wind, and the longer it holds the greater the calm, if it continues two or three days, a Feather will fall per|pendicular from a con&s;iderable height, &s;o that let the weight be what it will, or can, when ever it &s;tands it is al|ways calm, which may be further &s;aid to be almo&s;t more than true (if po&s;|&s;ible) for it may continue to increa&s;e or decrea&s;e one, two, or three parts in 24 hours, and yet it will continue calm from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t variation.</P>
<P>And &s;o for violent Storms, Tempe&s;ts, Hurricanes and Tornados, they being produced by &s;uch means related in the third Chapter, it will be impo&s;&s;ible any of them &s;hould happen, when the weight of the Air does not alter above two, three, four, five, or &s;ix parts in twenty four hours, nor indeed in half
<PB N="34" REF="26">that time, let the alteration be in what part of the variation it will, tho be|tween 2020 and 1980, five or &s;ix parts will be near as much as ten in any o|ther part: for if it be more than 2020, the Air is too dry or fair, &s;o there is nothing to put it into motion, and if it be le&s;s than 1980, it is too wet, or too much filled, and thickned every where with the Effluvious vapours to receive any &s;uch di&s;turbances; and the rea&s;ons why none of the&s;e violent tem|pe&s;ts never come when the weight of the Air alters no fa&s;ter, are that the Effluvious Vapours come &s;moothly on, and the Atmo&s;phere thickens by de|grees, and by that means our Hemi|&s;pherical part thereof is gradually filled to a greater or le&s;&s;er depth and thick|ne&s;s, and therefore mu&s;t be lei&s;urely di&s;charged in the manner related in the &s;econd Chapter about Rain, for thus our Hemi&s;phere is &s;ecured from all manner of violence, from outward at|tacks, or inward di&s;turbances of &s;trong Compre&s;&s;ions, confu&s;ed Eddies, and heaping Superonerations; yet when any of the&s;e violent Tempe&s;ts do come a calm mu&s;t preceed, and our Hemi|&s;pherical
<PB N="35" REF="26">part of the Atmo&s;phere mu&s;t continue very &s;till for &s;ome time before (for if the Air be in motion, tho in never &s;o gentle a cour&s;e, there can no &s;uch thing happen, becau&s;e it will be carried off by that current as it comes) that their productions may be the better collected and kept together; than in &s;uch places as are &s;ubject to the&s;e violences, they may be rea&s;ona|bly expected from &s;ome Cavernous Vulcanos, Calid Emotions, &s;trong Ef|ferve&s;cencies, Subterraneous or Sub|marine Eruptions, either &s;ingle or complicate, from one or more places, the Emanations being powerfully &s;ent up perpendicularly from the Hori|zon or inclining (as the di&s;po&s;ition of the Air is) for a con&s;iderable time, in &s;uch a calm &s;ea&s;on, (like &s;moak from Chimneys) they propel the Air before them, and &s;o make room for the other Effluvia that follows with the &s;ame &s;wiftne&s;s, and the re&s;t of the Atmo|&s;phere to unbend, if it inclines with its whole Ela&s;ticity, that makes as quick a current, till the propelled Air being &s;trengthned by a mighty <HI>Turba,</HI> can be driven no further, and the other fol|lowing
<PB N="36" REF="27">lowing with as great &s;trength, they become fenced on every &s;ide, with &s;uch mighty pre&s;&s;ures, that they fill the whole lower Region, and there|by in a manner keep off the whole body of &s;uperior Air from any gravi|tation, till at la&s;t it is di&s;charged in &s;o dreadful a manner, with &s;uch ama|zing di&s;plo&s;ions. And thus the&s;e Tempe&s;ts by a &s;mall inclination at their fir&s;t ri&s;ings may be carried a con&s;idera|ble di&s;tance from their local originals, and their skirts may chance to make &s;o great an alteration in the weight of the Air, that they may be expected there, if not carefully ob&s;erved, and &s;o in le&s;&s;er Storms, and al&s;o in &s;howery Sea&s;ons of temperate Countries, the weight of the Air will &s;ometimes al|ter in this manner, when no Rain can come within eight or ten miles of the place, but if the&s;e Tempe&s;ts in their perpendicular a&s;cen&s;ions are equally dilated on every &s;ide, they are in a little time di&s;charged very near the place of their fir&s;t productions, with more or le&s;s violence, accor|ding to the plenty of the Matter and di&s;po&s;ition of the neighbouring Air.</P>
<PB N="37" REF="27">
<P>Thus all the&s;e Tempe&s;ts are ea&s;ily foretold, for if in two, three, or four hours time the weight of the Air de|crea&s;es 20, 30, 40, or 50 parts, we may be certain &s;ome of the&s;e &s;orts of weather will follow, tho &s;ometimes the Winds will blow when the weight of the Air increa&s;es 10, 15 or 20 parts in &s;ix, eight or ten hours, but then it mu&s;t decrea&s;e lei&s;urely before, and a little rain before it ri&s;e. The &s;everal &s;orts of Tempe&s;ts may be di&s;tingui|&s;hed by the particular parts of the variation the decrea&s;e is made from, with re&s;pect to the Country and Sea|&s;on, yet if it begins about 2015, and decrea&s;es to 1980 or le&s;s, it will Thun|der tho in Winter; if it begins a|bout 2010, and re&s;t about 1970, it will be only Winds with very little Rain, but &s;uch Winds as very &s;eldom hap|pen. We had an example on the &s;ixth of <HI>February</HI> 1698/9, at 10 over night be|fore, a Cylinder of Air weighed 2011, the &s;ame morning at 7 it weighed 1991, at 10 in the forenoon it weigh|ed but 1965, which was 36 parts in three hours time, and 20 the night before, which were 56 in all, in twelve
<PB N="38" REF="28">hours time. It re&s;ted at 1965, till a|bout nine the next morning, at two afternoon it weighed 1970, and at night it weighed 2011 again, at 7 the next morning, which was the eighth, it weighed 2022. How &s;trong and tempe&s;tuous a wind we had at that time, not (I &s;uppo&s;e) be re|lated, few Hou&s;es e&s;caping its fury, and many Hou&s;es and Barns blown quit down; and many thou&s;ands of Elms in the Kingdom, and &s;everal Oakes, one near <HI>Ham&s;ted</HI> 5 miles from <HI>London,</HI> twi&s;ted like a Withe, of great Bigne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>What Fro&s;t and Thunder is? A conjecture at their Cau&s;es ond Production.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHat I have to &s;ay upon the&s;e two difficult Subjects, is chiefly from Experiments and Notions that have reciprocally directed one another in &s;ome further and more ea&s;ie ways of their productions, by the u&s;e of this In|&s;trument, yet am not arrived beyond conjectures, but hope they will eluci|date the&s;e things to a further di&s;cove|ry of the very truth it &s;elf. Fro&s;t and Thunder then, I believe, are not pro|duced by &s;uch means as have been formerly maintained, the fir&s;t from nitrous Saline particles di&s;per&s;ed in the Air, and was only thought to be the la&s;t effect or production of Cold, and the other from Nitro-Sulphureous par|ticles in the &s;ame manner di&s;per&s;ed, but then collected, and afterwards by ve|ry
<PB N="32" REF="29">hard or difficult means &s;et on fire in the mid&s;t of &s;o much Water. But Thunder I &s;uppo&s;e may be much ea&s;ier produced from a collection of the So|lar Rays, by a particular di&s;po&s;ition of the Effiuvious Vapours or Clouds, and Fro&s;t by a privation of tho&s;e and other Calorifick Corpu&s;cules, which create a certain &s;tifne&s;s, from a contrary ten|dance, and want of motion. But fir&s;t of Thunder, our Atmo&s;pherical Efflu|via having no other original than the Terraqueous Globe and its productions, how plentifully &s;oever they are &s;ent from the burning Mountains, Grottos and Vulcanos in <HI>Japan, China, Suma|tra, Fez, Fogo, Sicily,</HI> the <HI>Alps, Cali|fornia, New Spain,</HI> or other places, (&s;ome of which are &s;aid to ca&s;t their A&s;hes two hundred Miles about) either of Niter, Sulphur, Bitumine or any o|ther &s;imple or compounded combu&s;ti|ble matter from any other parts all of the Earth or Sea; they are all too much mixed with the Aqueous Particles that accompany them or the Clouds they compo&s;e, to be &s;et on fire in the Air, or to Thunder there, any other ways than with their Echos or Winds they

<P>WHat &s;ome A&s;trologers have told us about the alterations of the weather from the Planets, is no ways &s;atisfactory, and very &s;trange it &s;hould be continued down to the&s;e times, that &s;ome of our Vertuo&s;i have not told us &s;omething about that as well as o|ther natural di&s;coveries, that we might be no longer impo&s;ed upon, by telling us the &s;everal &s;orts of winds and wea|ther, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are appropriated to the &s;eve|ral Planets, but have told us neither Rea&s;on nor Cau&s;e of this Appropria|tion, and others that the &s;everal Planets are Authors of the&s;e &s;orts of winds and weather: and another that has writ only of the Weather tells us the Seven vi&s;ible Planets in the Skies have their Corre&s;pondent ones, in the Air, and in the Bowels of the Earth,
<PB N="56" REF="41">that are night and day at work in making tho&s;e forts of weather for us, and thereby undertakes to tell the cau&s;e of all the vulgar Progno&s;ticators errors, and the true way of judging the weather, with as much truth as the re&s;t: For indeed it is impo&s;&s;ible that either Winds, Rain, or fair wea|ther, Fro&s;t, Snow, or Thunder &s;hould proceed from the Planets, they being compo&s;ed of no &s;uch matters, nor are they intelligent to effect it, yet it mu&s;t be acknowledged that the Sun and Moon, and the re&s;t of the Planets, and other Stars have their particular Rays of Light (but whether the&s;e Rays of Light are Beams of fire or not, and differ only in quantity, and not in quality, as their different lights appear, and from whence they have their lights, whether inate or not, will be too much for this &s;hort account) and that tho&s;e from the Sun (e&s;peci|ally) at any time of the year (but too apparent to be que&s;tioned in Summer time) are of &s;ufficient power to di&s;|per&s;e &s;everal Vapours, Mi&s;ts and Clouds rai&s;ed from our Terraqueous Globe, for 'tis the Earth, and not the
<PB N="57" REF="41">Sun, Moon, or Stars that is the fir&s;t Mother of Meteors, 'tis the Terrene Emotions with &s;ome new modificati|ons that gives birth to them all, ac|cording to the fir&s;t, &s;econd, and third Chapters, and not the Planers conjoyn|ed in watery Signs, where may be they placed the watery Windows of Heaven, &s;poken of in the &s;eventh of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> that makes their <HI>Apertio Por|tarum,</HI> or opening the Gates of Heaven, and tho&s;e that rained Fire and Brim|&s;tone on <HI>Sodom</HI> in fiery Signs, and others in Airy ones, but we never heard what from earthly &s;igns, therefore as none of the&s;e &s;orts of weather can proceed from the Planets, &s;o neither can they from any of the Signs, nor the Planets con|joyned in them, but the Effluvia being rai&s;ed in the preceeding manner are in|determined Preci&s;ely, both to time and place, yet by &s;everal Eruptions, Propul|&s;ions, Rarefactions, Compre&s;&s;ions, and Re&s;ilitions they may receive, or meet with as well in their fir&s;t a&s;cen&s;ions as afterwards, they may be driven, &s;pread and di&s;charged to and in &s;everal di|&s;tant places, without any other a&s;&s;i|&s;tance, but the&s;e chiefly happen in the
<PB N="58" REF="42">Torrid Zone, or in &s;ome Hilly or Moun|tainous Countries, or near &s;ome Vul|canos, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by Paroxy&s;ms, and not often in more open and plain Coun|tries or Temperate Climates, and are con&s;tant no where, whereby the Efflu|via are &s;ometimes in the fir&s;t &s;ort of places left, and at mo&s;t times in other places, to the di&s;po&s;al of the Beams or Influences of the Heavens, which I believe may be evinced, of &s;ufficient power to alter and di&s;per&s;e them: Fir&s;t of the Sun Beams, which in mo&s;t Countries are known every day they appear, but a few hours to di&s;per&s;e all foggy Mi&s;ts and Vapours, and turn a dark Cloudy morning into a clear and fair Day, not by any occult property, but by a manife&s;t one, as all other heat in Boyling, Di&s;tilling, or other Co|ction does: and &s;o for winds, the ge|neral or Trade Winds, are always ac|cording to the Cour&s;e of the Sun or Earth, as far as the&s;e Beams and the inferiour Tract is conformable or proper, &s;ome degrees beyond the whole breadth of the Zodiack on ei|ther &s;ide, they con&s;tantly propelling all humid Vapours and Air before them,
<PB N="59" REF="42">and &s;o likewi&s;e the Mon&s;oons, which Sir <HI>Thomas Herbert</HI> in his Travels, &s;ays, begin exactly at the Sun's entrance into a Sign of the Zodiack, and blow half a year con&s;tantly that way, till the Sun enter into the oppo&s;ite De|gree, and then they blow in the &s;ame manner the other way. Captain <HI>Swanly</HI> &s;ays, the Mon&s;oons raigns five months on one &s;ide of the Compa&s;s, and five months on the other, and that there are two months in which they change, are variable (or break up, as &s;ome term the&s;e alterations) in <HI>March</HI> and <HI>September,</HI> when the Sun cro&s;&s;es the Line, and as long as the Sun is on the north &s;ide of the Aequator, to the Tro|pique of Cancer, the winds are to the northward, and veery more northerly according to the cour&s;e of the months, and when on the South &s;ide of the AE|quinoctial, the winds blow from thence in the &s;ame manner, and thus al&s;o there is half a year of fair Mon|&s;oons, and half a year of Rainy and fowl Mon&s;oons, and that the fair Mon&s;oons blow off the Shoars, and the Rainy Mon&s;oons on the Shoars, and that near all Lands, between the

<PB N="61" REF="43">heat and cold, wet and dry weather proceeded from the Sun's local po&s;iti|on, on the North or South &s;ide of their Zenith, or Equator, as his Rays de|cline from their perpendicularity, and not from fiery, airy, watery, or earth|ly Signs, for the Sun beams are not earthly in us, nor watery in &Taurus;, but fiery in &Cancer;, and always &s;o powerful in the Torid Zone, that they are the chief efficients of all the&s;e &s;orts of weather, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the other Planets, there being hardly any room for any of their beams to crowd in.</P>
<P>Secondly, of the beams of the Moon, the&s;e being from a le&s;&s;er light have not &s;o many manife&s;t operations as tho&s;e of the Sun, yet are known in &s;everal places of <HI>India,</HI> and the Torid Zone to cau&s;e contractures in the Bodies of tho&s;e that are too long expo&s;ed to them, as well to the Natives as Strangers, tho more to the latter, and that &s;everal are made Lame, or el&s;e have had &s;ome of their Limbs contracted for &s;everal weeks, and &s;ome for as many months, and others to their lives end, if they happen to &s;leep where the Moon &s;hines upon them, which &s;everal of our Sea|men
<PB N="62" REF="44">who go to tho&s;e places have al&s;o &s;een, and a friend of mine, a Relation and Merchant that Traded and Lived &s;ometime in the I&s;land of <HI>Sunda</HI> at <HI>Achem</HI> in <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and <HI>Bantum</HI> in <HI>Java</HI> and had traveled many other parts of <HI>India,</HI> a&s;&s;ured me he had &s;een &s;everal that had their Limbs contracted, and their Mouths or Necks &s;o drawn a&s;ide and twi&s;ted by the beams of the Moon, that they were very &s;urpri&s;ing to be|hold, and that he him&s;elf when he came fir&s;t into tho&s;e parts, before he was acquainted with it, took up his Lodging after an extream hot day (according to the cu&s;tom of the place) in the open air, with &s;lender cover|ing, where the Moons beams could fully come for good part of the night which being pa&s;t before he waked, when he went to ri&s;e, he found the left &s;ide of his neck, and up to his Ear, and the &s;ame Arm and Soulder (which was very much expo&s;ed) &s;o &s;tiff that he was &s;carce able to &s;tir him&s;elf, and was forced to keep with|in eight or ten days to be cured, which was done by the con&s;tant u&s;e of in|ward and outward Aromaticks of the
<PB N="63" REF="44">Country for that time, and that the Country people told him the next morning, if he had acquainted them with his de&s;ign, or had pa&s;&s;ed the night where they did, he would have prevented that mi&s;chief by lodging in a place unexpo&s;ed to the Moons Beams.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons of the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters mu&s;t be that the beams of the Moon like tho&s;e of the Sun, do propel the Ter|rene Effluvia before them, but having no &s;uch heat as they have, the&s;e Ef|fluvia thus driven, enter the Pores of the Body in the expo&s;ed parts with a contrary tendency, and much le&s;s agitated than the Animal Spirits and Humours, and thereby cool and ob|&s;truct their natural motions, and circu|lations, the&s;e Nutricious Spirits and Juices being thus hindred, a paucid Lympha &s;upplies (which has no &s;uch motion) and thereby Tumefies, Contra|cts and hinders the proper motion of the part it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, which the heat of the body &s;oon ex&s;iccates (may be as it comes), and &s;o confirms it: and as the&s;e people &s;ay, it is only the beams of the Moon, &s;o neither can we &s;up|po&s;e
<PB N="64" REF="45">it &s;hould be any thing el&s;e, for it &s;hould proceed from the Wind or cold Damps, then it might be as well when the Moon did not &s;hine upon them, or in &s;ome other parts than tho&s;e on which it did &s;hine, which is not known, and when they do take up their lodging in the open air we cannot &s;uppo&s;e neither that the Wind &s;hould be concentred upon them through any crack or hole: be&s;ides be|ing in the open air, the continual Streams or Effiuvia of their own bodies both warm and keep off the neighbour|ing air from every part, equal to the pow|er and &s;trength of their motions, and &s;o &s;ecures them in all places that are but moderately calm and &s;till. Then for the Beams of the other Planets and Stars, there is none can &s;ay they are refracted, either by the Aether, Air, or Atmo&s;phere, but that they pa&s;s directly down upon us, and &s;o penetrate every part of all the&s;e in their de&s;cen&s;ions, as we &s;ee and know their light is &s;ent down thus far; the&s;e beams therefore having &s;o great a power, (notwith&s;tanding the con|&s;tant Diurnal Circumgyration of the Earth or Heavens) to continue their
<PB N="65" REF="45">direct cour&s;es hither, mu&s;t needs move, alter and impell the Effluvious Air before them (but yet no other ways than according to their direct po&s;iti|ons) and &s;o may either bring or car|ry from us mi&s;ty, rainy or &s;nowy Vo|pours, or otherways may put the Air into a direct or contrary motion, and &s;o produce Winds, Storms, Tempe&s;ts, Thunders, Hurricanes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which may thus be foretold at any time, and from what quarter the Wind will blow, with as much certainty as their Motions, and Po&s;itions are known, and by this means there will be (or rather is) a new account of their A&s;|pects, according to the Lines and An|gles they make at the earth, and not among&s;t them&s;elves, nor from fiery, airy, watery, or earthly &s;igns, for nei|ther of the&s;e can have any re&s;pect to us, of which this Barometer has given a Diagram, that by taking the Planets places from an Ephemeris to their true places in that, all the alterations of weather, and winds from their Quarters may be foretold at any time.</P>
<PB N="66" REF="46">
<P>And further tho not &s;o proper here, the&s;e beams that are able to penetrate, move and alter the air, which we can no ways &s;ub&s;i&s;t, nor live one hour without, are as capable to penetrate our bodies as that (which we know the beams of the Sun does, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) and move and alter our &s;pirits, and &s;o the &s;pirits of all other bodies which can|not be le&s;s &s;ubject to the&s;e motions and alterations than ours are, and if our &s;pirits and the &s;pirits of all other bodies may be moved and altered by the&s;e beams, then the&s;e &s;pirits being the immediate cau&s;es, and only princi|ples of Life, Power, Vertue, Force and Strength, it will be impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be altred and changed, and no alterations made in the bodies them|&s;elves; therefore a le&s;s limit of the power of the&s;e beams cannot be &s;et, than what mu&s;t at length terminate as well in the bodies them&s;elves. All which I hope to demon&s;trate further by infalliable proofs, if life and lei&s;ure &s;erve, in a Treati&s;e by it &s;elf, what the&s;e Beams and Motions are, that they have power to cau&s;e all the alte|rations of winds and weather we are
<PB N="67" REF="46">acquainted with, and all other com|mon alterations in our and other Ani|mal Bodies and Spirits, by the Lines and Angles they make at the Earth, and not by their beholding one ano|ther, by Sextile, Quartile, Trine or Oppo&s;ition, which may &s;erve till then, for tho it be the fir&s;t, yet I believe the mo&s;t that ever was publi&s;hed before in this way, and que&s;tion not but future Ob&s;ervations will confirm (not the Names and Motions, but) the Laws of the Stars thereby, for from hence there is a rea&s;on why the Planets, Poles of Po&s;itions, and the Divi&s;ions of the Heavens are taken according to the Latitude of the Place, in an Oblique Sphere, and many other things as perti|nent, butreferred till then.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>That it is impo&s;&s;ible by any Hygro&s;cope, Thermometer or other Invention to know the true &s;tate of the Air.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAving now given a &s;hort account of the preceding Heads, it will be convenient to &s;ay &s;omething of the common In&s;truments that are u&s;ed to foretell the alterations of weather by; or that the alterations of the Air are u&s;ed to have an influence upon; and &s;uch are of three &s;orts. Fir&s;t &s;uch as imbibe the Effluvious Air, and are Cal|lid Hygro&s;copes. Secondly, &s;uch as have a parcel of Air included with ting'd Spirits and &s;ealed up in Cylindrical Gla&s;&s;es, and are Callid Thermometers: or thirdly, &s;uch as contain &s;ome &s;pi|rituous or other liquid in a Cylindri|cal pipe of Gla&s;s, clos'd at one end, and open at the other, and inverted into an open Vial or Ci&s;tern of the &s;ame
<PB N="69" REF="47">liquor, expo&s;ed to the open Air, and are Callid Thermo&s;copes or Baro|&s;copes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Hygro&s;copes are of &s;everal &s;orts, but the mo&s;t Fam'd one is that of a wild Oat-beard, de&s;cribed in Mr <HI>Hookes</HI> Mirrographia, <HI>page</HI> 147, others are made of Sheeps Gutts or Fiddle-&s;trings, Pieces of Leather, Ropes, Cords, Sponge, Wool, Paper or Deal-&s;havings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and may be made of any other thing that will imbi be the humid Air, or that the Air can ea&s;ily penetrate, as Willow, Sallow, Ozier, Alder, and other &s;oft woods.</P>
<P>That of an Oat-beard turns and un|turns in dry and moi&s;t weather, and is fitted with an Index that points to all the variations; Sheeps-guts, Fid|dle-&s;trings, Pieces of Leather, Ropes and other Cords are fa&s;tened again&s;t &s;ome Wall, Board or Timber, and ex|tended either Horizontally or Per|pendicularly, and then a convenient weight hung on the middle or other end will ri&s;e and fall in wet and dry weather.</P>
<P>Sponge, Wooll, Paper, or Deal-&s;havings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are tyed together with
<PB N="70" REF="48">&s;ome &s;tring, or in a thin Silk or Li|nen Ca&s;e, or Bag, in a round or oval form or balance, with Scales and Weights, which will be heavier or lighter in wet or dry weather.</P>
<P>The imperfections of all which are ea&s;ily &s;een, fir&s;t, in re&s;pect of them|&s;elves and their adju&s;tings; and &s;econd|ly, in re&s;pect of the alterations of the Air, in re&s;pect of them&s;elves, the Oat|beards will in a little time grow much more &s;tiff, hard, clo&s;e, and brittle, and in&s;tead of two, three, or four times turning about will not turn once, and not long before it will not move at all, which it gradually comes to as it grows more and more Ramalious, or &s;are and Dead, for which rea&s;on al&s;o there can be no certain adju&s;ting of that, for by the time it can be adju&s;ted at fir&s;t, the Tex|ture of its parts will be &s;o much altered in relation to its motion, that it will want a new adju&s;tion, and &s;o Sheeps-gutts, Fiddle-&s;trings, Pieces of Leather, Ropes, or other Cords, do all alter in the &s;ame manner; nor can Sponge, Wooll, Paper, or Deal-&s;havings, or any other &s;uch thing? be pre&s;erved or any ways &s;ecured from the &s;ame inconvenience?
<PB N="81" REF="48">but if they could, it would yet be impo&s;|&s;ible they &s;hould &s;hew any alteration of weather with any manner of cer|tainty, for as they only imbibe, and are receptacles of the &s;ubtile Humid Vapours, that &s;ometimes fill the low|er Regions before it rains, &s;o they can &s;hew no other alterations, but what they make in their coming and going, which are &s;ometimes much more in Mi&s;ts after it has rained, or when there is no rain follows, or upon the going a way of a Fro&s;t, or melting of a Snow, than at coming of the greate&s;t rains, and &s;o on the contrary, when the&s;e Vapours cannot come &s;o low in fro&s;ty or windy weather, they will &s;hew no alteration till after the rain is come, and Snow &s;eldom makes any al|terations in them, except it melts as it falls: And in Summer time and dry Sea&s;ons, it is &s;o al&s;o, no alteration till the rain is coming, or that it have rained, but if a mi&s;ty morning happen, they will alter much more. Be&s;ides, if all the&s;e inconveniencies could be preven|ted, they cannot well be put into a travelling Security, by rea&s;on of the &s;everal alterations they will be &s;ubject
<PB N="82" REF="49">to from the heat of the Body, Warmth, and Fires in Hou&s;es, and the different tempers of the Air abroad.</P>
<P>Secondly, tho&s;e that have a parcel of Air included with tinged Spirits, and &s;ealed up in Cylindrical Gla&s;&s;es, the&s;e for di&s;tinction are called Hermetick Thermometers, and of a later inventi|on, and thereby thought by &s;ome to exceed all other di&s;coveries for heat and cold, but are not pretended, nor intended, to &s;hew any thing el&s;e, which by the natural Expan&s;ion and Contraction of the included Air with heat, and cold, gives way for the ri|&s;ing and falling of the Spirits, and have no manner of tendency for wet and dry, and therefore of very &s;mall u&s;e or &s;ervice; for we know the wea|ther is &s;ometimes very cold, yet fair and dry, and &s;ometimes as cold when it rains, &s;nows, or blows, and &s;ometimes fair and dry in hot weather, and &s;ome|times as wet or windy. But as the former are deficient in wet and dry, &s;o are the&s;e in heat and cold, and it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould &s;hew any truth in what they pretend, for no body has yet told us the proportion between
<PB N="83" REF="49">the Head and the Cylinder, nor can they make two to rife and fall alike, with the &s;ame Spirits, nor have they told us what is be&s;t to put in them, whether Spirits of Wine, Vinegar, Salt, Vitriol, Tartar or Sulphur, or Oyl of Turpentine, Amber, Wax, or Anis, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or other things, be&s;ides all liquids are expanded, and contracted with Heat and Cold, &s;o apparently, that our Seamen have ob&s;erved their Ships to draw le&s;s Water in Cold and Frozen Countries (tho the Water is not in tho&s;e places &s;o Salt, therefore not naturally &s;o heavy) than they do in warmer places, &s;o that the Water is thicker and heavier in cold than in warmer places, and &s;ea&s;ons: and the Honourable E&s;quire <HI>Boyle</HI> has ob&s;erved it to Dilate and Contract it &s;elf in the &s;ame day, by a Hermetick Gla&s;s Bub|ble, that would &s;ink in Water at noon time, and ri&s;e and &s;wim night and morning. Therefore if Water will thus vi&s;ibly Dilate and Contract it &s;elf in &s;uch large quantities and places, it will be much more &s;o in the &s;lender &s;tem of a Thermometer, and any &s;ort of volatile &s;pirits, a great many times
<PB N="84" REF="50">more than Salt or other Fountain Wa|ter, and thus al&s;o &s;ome Spirits will Dilate and Contract more than o|thers, which makes all the&s;e things the more uncertain, and no body knows how much the&s;e &s;pirits will Dilate and Contract them&s;elves by Heat or Cold; yet there is a way to make a Thermometer free from all the&s;e exceptions, which I have per|formed in another way: then for the other &s;orts that are called Thermo|&s;copes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that alter both with Heat and Cold, Wet and Dry, by having Air in the top of the Cylinder, and ex|po&s;ed to the pre&s;&s;ure of the air at the bottom, the&s;e are the greate&s;t confu|&s;ion that can be, for they &s;hew no|thing of truth but by chance, nor can any body tell when they do, or do not, for if it be cold and wet, the cold will contract the air above to make it ri&s;e, and the wet will lighten the Atmo|&s;pherical Cylinder to make it &s;ink, thus it is unpo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould ri&s;e and fall at the &s;ame time, and &s;o in hot and fair weather, the heat will dilate the air above to make it &s;ink, and in fair weather the Atme&s;phere pre&s;&s;es
<PB N="85" REF="50">the heavie&s;t at the bottom, to make it ri&s;e, and thus whenever they ri&s;e or fall no body can tell whether it be for heat or cold, wet or dry weather.</P>
<P>Then for the Quick&s;ilver-Gla&s;s, or Common Barometer, there is none that have them but know they will &s;ome|times fall or &s;ink very con&s;iderably, yet no rain follow, and at other times rain if it &s;ink never &s;o little, and a|gain &s;ometimes it will be fair, tho it ri&s;e, but little, and at other times very wet when it ri&s;es con&s;iderably: Nor have they given us any certain rules to know when it will rain or be fair, &s;o that all the&s;e In&s;truments are very im|perfect and can no ways be tru&s;ted to. And thus I have told the Rea&s;ons, and next for the U&s;e of that, that will do all the&s;e things.</P>

<PB N="88" REF="52">quantity, &s;o we have the exact weight by mea&s;ure, but if to mea&s;ure the Depth as well, it mu&s;t be balanced at the bottom, whereby we have the Depth by weight, and the weight of what quanti|ty we plea&s;e.

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. <HI>Rules for the more certain knowledge of all the alterations of weather, both in quantity and quality.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FIr&s;t, to have the Barometer alwaies with us, that we may alwaies know the weight of the Air, and how it has been two, three or four days before, whether growing lighter or heavier, and in what part of the variation it is. Then fir&s;t in Summer it may weigh near 2060, and if it decrea&s;e 3 or 4 parts in 24 hours, it may hold till it comes to 2010, before it rains, which will be but little.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. If it decrea&s;e from about 2060, to 2040 in 24 hours or le&s;s, it will be windy, yet clear and dry, but it will hold but a little while, for it will &s;oon increa&s;e again, but this &s;el|dom happens.</P>
<PB N="92" REF="54">
<P N="3">3dly. If it weighs 2040, and de|crea&s;es 16, 18 or 20 parts in 24 hours the wind will blow, and it will rain a little, but it will be only a Storm, and after that it will increa&s;e again in an hour or two, and be fair.</P>
<P N="4">4ly. If it weighs 2030 and decrea&s;e to 2020 in 18 or 24 hours, it will be windy for a day, but if it rain it will be only a &s;mall &s;hower or two of a few minutes continuance.</P>
<P N="5">5ly. If it weighs about 2030 and decrea&s;e 2 or 3 parts in 18 or 24 hours, it may decrea&s;e to 1980 or le&s;s before it rains, which will then be for a whole day, with a &s;oft driving wind.</P>
<P N="6">6ly. If it weighs 2030, and decrea&s;e to 2000 in 18 or 24 hours it will Thunder, Lighten, Rain and Blow in a very violent manner, and pour down a Sea of water in a few hours, with terrible Di&s;plo&s;ions of Wind and Thunder, hardly to be di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P N="7">7ly. If it weighs about 2030, 2026 or 24 and decrea&s;e to 1990, 1985, or 80, in 16 or 18 hours, it will be a mo&s;t violent Hurricane with mo&s;t vi|olent Winds, Thunders and Light|ning,
<PB N="93" REF="54">as if the whole Heavens were on fire, with as violent rain poured down by whole Seas, for &s;ome hours or half a day together.</P>
<P N="8">8ly. If it weighs about 2020, and decrea&s;es to 1980 in 18 or 24 hours it will Rain, Thunder and Lighten, and be as great a Tempe&s;t as we com|monly have in the&s;e parts, and may hold the bige&s;t part of a day, or night as it begins.</P>
<P N="9">9ly. If it weighs but 2010, and decrea&s;e to 1980 in 18 or 24 hours, it will Thunder and Lighten and be very Windy and Tempe&s;tous with large Hail and Rain, to the turning up of &s;everal Hou&s;es and Trees, tho in <HI>January.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10ly. If it weighs about 2010, and decrea&s;e to 1980, 1975 or 70 in 12 or 16 hours it it will be Windy to a Miracle with little or no rain, but if it be 24 or 30 hours, in making this decrea&s;e it will then be Windy and Rainy with Hail and Thunder.</P>
<P N="11">11. If it weighs about 2000, and decrea&s;e to 1980 or near the matter, in 18 or 24 hours it will be &s;tormy
<PB N="94" REF="55">with Rain and Hail and Winds, but calm intermi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P N="12">12. If it weighs but 1990, and decrea&s;e to 1970, 65 or 60 in 18 or 24 hours, it will be very tempe&s;tuous with Wind, &s;mall Hail, Rain and Thunder, but mo&s;t Wind, and that Wind like Thunder.</P>
<P N="13">13. If it weighs about 1990, and decrea&s;e 2 or 3 parts in 24 hours, if it decrea&s;e never &s;o long it will rain all the while, but if it &s;tands or increa&s;e a little, tho it weighs but 1970 or le&s;s it will be fair.</P>
<P N="14">14. If it weighs but 1980, and de|crea&s;e 2 or 3 parts in 24 hours there will be very cold Rain all the while, and if it weighs but 1970, and &s;o de|crea&s;ing it will Snow tho at Mid&s;um|mer and be very cold and very wet, more like Winter than Summer.</P>
<P N="15">15. If it weighs but 1960 as, it can|not weigh much le&s;s two days toge|ther in Summer, &s;o we may be &s;ure it will be very cold wet and win|terly.</P>
<P N="16">16. And from what weight &s;oever it decrea&s;es 3 or 4 parts in 12 hours,
<PB N="95" REF="55">if it have &s;tood 2 or 3 days before, it will be windy with fre&s;h and plea&s;ant Gales: And if it increa&s;e 5 or 6 parts in 12 hours from any weight, after it have &s;tood as before, it will be a lit|tle windy.</P>
<P>There &s;hould be 3 or 4 Rules more for the increa&s;e, but that being for the mo&s;t part fair or windy, except between 1980 and 2000, they may be omitted for the pre&s;ent: Thus for the decrea&s;ing to the Winter, and tho Winter have brought it to &s;o &s;mall a weight, yet it will not hold, except it begins about 2000 or 1995 at lea&s;t.</P>
<P N="17">17. Therefore if it continues to weigh 2000 or 1995 parts, two or 3 days in Winter, it will freeze, &amp; the longer it holds, of that weight the more, but if it increa&s;e 2 or 3 parts in 24 hours, two or three days together it will go away, and if it decrea&s;e two or three parts in 24 hours, it will continue and Freeze harder and harder, as long as it &s;o decrea&s;es, till at la&s;t it may not weigh above 1945 or 1950, and yet it will be very fair and clear, but very &s;harp
<PB N="96" REF="56">Fro&s;t as long as it holds of that weight</P>
<P N="18">18. Thus being of the lea&s;t weight it can be, if it increa&s;e from 1945 or 50, to 1960 in 24 hours, it will be windy, but very clear and extreme &s;harp and freezing; and &s;o al&s;o if the weight decrea&s;e from 1960 to 1950 or le&s;s in 24 hours time, it will be &s;uch a freezing wind, but if it increa&s;e or decrea&s;e but one or two parts in 24 hours between the&s;e two, there will be very little alterations, only clear and freezing.</P>
<P N="19">19. If it increa&s;e from 1960 to 1970 in 24 hours, it will Snow the next day in Storms, but it will &s;oon be over, and decrea&s;e again, but if it increa&s;e from 1960, 2 or 3 parts in 24 hours till it weighs 1970, or 1975, it will Snow con&s;iderably, and if in Snowing the weight increa&s;e, it will Snow the more, but if it decrea&s;e it will be the le&s;s.</P>
<P N="20">20. If it increa&s;e from 1970 to 1980, or 1985 in 24 hours time, it will be very windy, and at la&s;t Rain, and then decrea&s;e again, and Thaw,
<PB N="97" REF="56">but if it increa&s;e again, the Fro&s;t will not remain, as it will notwith&s;tanding the rain if it decrea&s;e, and if it in|crea&s;e 2 or parts in 24 hours till it weighs 1980 or 85 the fro&s;t will cer|tainly go with plenty of rain.</P>
<P N="21">21. If it increa&s;e from 1980 to 1990 it will be fair and freeze again, and if it increa&s;e 2 or 3 parts in 24 hours will hold till it weighs 2318 or 2020, but then it will grow warm and mi&s;ty (fir&s;t thawing in the Air) and the fro&s;t will go away without rain, nay &s;o much without, that it will be fair and clear all the while it is go|ing, tho in the mid&s;t of Winter.</P>
<P N="22">22. If it increa&s;e from 1999 to 2000 in 12 or 16 hours it will be windy the &s;ame day, and then decrea&s;e a lit|tle and rain the next, but if it increa&s;e but a little it will hold fair and be calm.</P>
<P N="23">23. If it increa&s;e from 2000 to 2020, 2030, or 40 in 18 or 24 hours it will be windy, but fair, yet rain the next day by &s;torms, and after that a &s;et|tled warm rain, but if it increa&s;es lei&s;urely it will hold fair all the while.</P>
<PB N="98" REF="57">
<P N="24">24. If it increa&s;e to a bigger weight, it will be more like Summer than Win|ter, very fair clear and warm, with|out any fro&s;t. The truth of all which is very plain from the former Chap|ters, and the following Experiments.</P>
<P>In <HI>December</HI> 1696, when I was &s;ure I could weigh and mea&s;ure any parcel of Air, ob&s;erving &s;ome alterations of weather, that I could not then give a|ny rea&s;on for, I bought a common Ba|rometer or Quick&s;ilver-Gla&s;s, and then an Hermetick Thermometer, by which I made &s;everal other &s;orts to com|pare my own, and all their differen|ces with the alterations of the weather in a Diary, which I continued to <HI>June</HI> 1699, on the 12 of <HI>January</HI> 96/7 a fro&s;t began (which proved to be the harde&s;t &s;ince the great one, 13 years before;) the Air weighed that day 1996 and continued with very little alteration till the 16th, after which it decrea&s;ed 2 or 3 parts, and &s;ometimes 4 in 24 hours, to the end of the month, when it weighed but 1950; the &s;e|cond of <HI>February</HI> it increa&s;ed a little and weighed 1962; on the fourth when there was &s;o &s;harp a freez|ing
<PB N="99" REF="57">wind, that my hand on the Iron handle of a Pail or Well-Bucket, it would cleave &s;o fa&s;t to it that it was ready to pull off the skin to take my hand off again, or to try with my fing|er as &s;everal others did, by dabbing on a fre&s;h place of the Iron, it immediate|ly &s;tuck &s;o fa&s;t it made it very &s;ore to pull off, and could not indure to do it above a time or two. After the fourth it decrea&s;ed again till the &s;eventh, when it weighed but a little above 1949, where it continued 12 days to the 19th, and was very &s;harp, but after that it began to incera&s;e a|gain &s;lowly, till the 6th of <HI>March,</HI> when it weighed 1968, and went a way a few days after. About the 20th of <HI>January</HI> when the weight of the Air was abated about 19 parts, and the Quick&s;ilver &s;unk between three and four tenths, I began to think the weather would alter in a few days to Rain or Snow, but weighing thus till the end of the month, the Air growing lighter and lighter all the while, and the Quick&s;ilver at la&s;t near half way below Rain, and yet the weather clear, and more &s;harp and
<PB N="100" REF="58">freezing by the Hermetick Thermo|meter, was I thought the &s;trange&s;t thing that could happen, I therefore weigh|ed and mea&s;ured &s;everal quantities or particles of Air, in Cylinders, Cones, Globes and other figures of &s;everal dementions, &s;ome times 18 or 20 times in a day in &s;everal di&s;tant pla|ces, Tops of Hills, Vallies, Deep|wells, Mines, and Coal-pits, warm fire Rooms, Stoves, and open Air; And thus at la&s;t with a great deal of Pains and Co&s;t found the Air it &s;elf was frozen, and thereby kept off the Superiour Gravitation, and by continu|ing the&s;e means, the rea&s;ons of all the other alterations of weather as well hot as cold, wet and dry, Wind, and Thunder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>November</HI> the 28th 1697, a little fro&s;t began of about 8 days, that day the Air weighed 1972, the 30th it weighed 1997, the 3d of <HI>December</HI> it weighed 2022, the 5th 2034, being very fair all the while (and froze very hard about the 1d and 2d) the next day it grew warm, but then decrea&s;ed to 2003 in 24 hours, there was fir&s;t a lit|tle Snow, then &s;mall Rain, and the fro&s;t went away.</P>
<PB N="101" REF="58">
<P>But <HI>December</HI> the 3d 1698 having been fro&s;ty for &s;ometime, the weight of the Air increa&s;ed to 2020, the 4th was very fair yet thawed apace, the mornings and evenings a little mi&s;ty with the thaw, but otherways very clear and &s;o went away without any Rain.</P>
<P>The 29th. of <HI>October</HI> at night 1697 the Air weighed 2018 the next morn|ing it weighed but 1996, the day was very windy but no Rain.</P>
<P>But the effects of the Greate&s;t wind that have been for many years are rela|ted in the 5th Chapter.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> the 10th 1699, the Air weigh|ed but 1978, the 11th it weighed 1996, there was fir&s;t a little &s;mall rain, but after that very windy, the 12th in the morning at &s;ix it weigh|ed 2018, at 10 but 1990, at 12 1988, about 3 or 4 in the afternoon, being near <HI>Maidenhead,</HI> there was a very &s;trange and unu&s;ual Tempe&s;t in the adjacent parts of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and <HI>Bark|&s;hire,</HI> of Wind and Thunder and Light|ning, with Hail, and Rain, with that violence or &s;trangene&s;s, that the Di&s;|plo&s;ive Crackes of Wind and Thun|der
<PB N="102" REF="59">were hardly to be di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P><HI>April the</HI> 16th following, being near <HI>London</HI> at noon the Air weighed 2005, at 9 at night but 1987, the 17th at 6 in the morning it weighed but 1970, about 2 afternoon it began to be a little Stormy, and at 4 a great Tempe&s;t of Thunder and Lightning, Hail and Rain. I have many other remarkable alterations of Rain, Snow, Cold, Hot, Wet and Dry weather, but re&s;erve them with the &s;everal other things for another opportunity.</P>

<P>SInce the former &s;heets were in the Pre&s;s the continual u&s;e of this Barome|ter has di&s;cover'd &s;everal other things that former Ages were u&s;ed to think too Good for their Enemies, or Un|gratitude, which, may be, was the Rea&s;on that have hindred us from tho&s;e Advantages: Some of the&s;e are, Fir&s;t, the true Cau&s;e or Rea&s;on of the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea, in &s;o plain and &s;atisfactory a manner, that it leaves no room for the le&s;t &s;cruple about it, and Salves all the Appear|ances (with Mathematical Certainty) of that hitherto unknown mighty work of nature, why the highe&s;t and lowe&s;t Spring and Nape Tides, are Con&s;tantly about three days after the Change, Full and Quarters of the Moon; And why the Spring and
<PB REF="60">Nape Tides are &s;o much greater in March and September than at any other time of the year, And why there is 15 or 16 Foot Difference be|tween high and low Water in &s;ome Places, and not above 3 or 4 in o|thers: And though I have neither had neither time nor opportunity to ob|&s;erve it, &s;ince I Di&s;cover'd it, yet I am &s;ure it is not the Moons being upon a Certain Meridian that makes it high or low Water at that time, the &s;ame day, but a Particular and Proper Di&s;tance of the Sun and Moon, 24 hours, or more, before that time, All which is as Plain as the Tides are vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>And immediately after it di&s;cover|ed the true Rea&s;on of the Magnetick Needles Pointing to the North and South, and of its variations: And that many other things &s;o Placed will have the &s;ame Tendences, as I &s;oon Experienc'd. After which, I tried &s;e|veral others Exactly fitted in as ma|ny Fluid Currents, which all &s;tood the &s;ame way: For if they were nice|ly fitted in true Aequilibrium, and Both Ends of equal di&s;tance from the
<PB REF="60">Centre they would not Point but Lie Cro&s;s the Current: But if being in Aquilibrium, one End were longer than the other, they would not lie Cro&s;s, but Point, and which End that was, may ea&s;ily be gue&s;s'd. From whence we may be &s;ure the Longi|tude Can never be truly found by the Variation, or the Variation of the Variation, as &s;ome have thought.</P>
<P>It has Di&s;cover'd &s;everal other things about the Prime and original Cau&s;e of Winds, Rain, Hail, Fro&s;t, Snow, Thunder, and other Meteors: what it is that gives the Air that motion we call Wind originally, and what Gathers Clowds, and Conden&s;es the Effluvia into Rain, That it is not the influence of &male; or &Jupit;, nor the Cente|ral motion of the Sun, nor always the Latitude of the Place that makes Warm or Cold Weather: But that the Cloudes do always Concenturate the Sun Beams to make Thunder, with a further mo&s;t Plain and Sen&s;i|ble Demon&s;tration of the Influence of the Stars (that are &s;o &s;weet and bind|ing, and in their Cour&s;es fought a|gain&s;t <HI>Si&s;era</HI>) in all Re&s;pects as Appa|rent
