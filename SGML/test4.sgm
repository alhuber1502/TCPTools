<PB REF="3">
other, written, hard to
say, whether more conceit|fully
or completely, are here
translated out of their Latin
into English. A labour grea|ter
farre (as all our learned
know) then for the slender
bulke of the volume. His
Maiesties great example,
and your Lordships feruent
imitation, to increase in the
ful sail of fortune, the balasse
of worthy readings, is here
in part well fitted. For your
Honour cannot possibly find
in so little a room so much, so
well together, of this weigh|tie
argument. A thing to
your Lordship acceptable,
considering your small lei|sure,
and to all those other
who haue already profitably
<PB REF="3">
runne through his authors:
himselfe so briefe as it is al|most
his fault; so neate, and
pithy, as <HI>Liuie</HI> fares the
worse for it, so desirous to re|member
what himselfe hath
said, and to haue it vnder|stood
by others, as he summs
his owne summarie narrati|ons;
and finally, so worthy, as
seeing the glorie of a great
Historian forestall'd by <HI>Li|uie,</HI>
and others, hee held it
more honorable to be (as hee
is) the first among briefe
writers, then one among few
in the large ones. <HI>Epito|me's</HI>
notwithstanding are no
other in truth but Anato|mies,
and all spacious minds,
waited vpon with the felici|ties
of meanes, and leisure,
<PB REF="4">
will flie them as bane, but this
briefe hath all the requisites
of a perfect body, and appar|rell
as rich as any; for profes|sing
Storie, he hath certain|ly
performed a <HI>Panegyrick.</HI>
His scope, to kindle the va|lor
of the old <HI>Roman</HI> world
in the bosome of the new:
though himselfe, an heathen
man, and liuing vnder <HI>Tra|ian</HI>
the emperour, saw the
proportion of valour well-maintained:
that being the
most goodly, and most flouri|shing
estate, which at any
time vnder heathen princes,
that monarchie enioyed.
Those annotations, and col|lections,
whose lights will
lead your Lordship into the
wise, and heroik secret of the

<P>_FLORVS (saith
IVSTVS LIP|SIVS,
who in
M^r. CAMDENS
opinion carryed the Sunne
of antiquity before him)
<HI>wrote a briefe, not so much
of</HI> Liuie <HI>(from whom he of|ten
dissenteth) as of the</HI> Ro|man
<HI>affaires, in my poore
conceite, aptly, elegantly,
neatly. There is in him a
sharpnesse of wit, and short|nesse
of speech, oftentimes
admirable; and certaine
gemmes as it were, and
<PB REF="6">
iewels of wise sentences, in|serted
by him with good ad|uisement,
and veritie.</HI> Thus
farre that excellent master,
and with him let thy
iudgement goe, if thou
wilt herein doe iustice,
howsoeuer, with <HI>Mathe|maticall
Stadius,</HI> FLORVS
is but <HI>a tumultuarie author:</HI>
for so it pleaseth that lear|ned
Critike to style him,
ouer-loading him with
the comparison of incom|parable
<HI>Liuie.</HI> Bee it free,
with reuerence and mo|destie,
to note ouer-sights
(as none doe want them)
and for me also, a profes|sour
of sober freedome, to
taxe that as an ouer-sight
in manners, to vse such au|thors
<PB REF="6">
sowrely, without
whom the Criticks fame
had often-times beene ob|scure,
or none at all. In
mine <HI>Hypercriticks,</HI> con|cerning
our countreys
Historie, I haue dealt free|ly,
as a man desirous to
stirre vp a <HI>Liuie,</HI> or a <HI>Flo|rus</HI>
to our selues. There is
little left testifide touching
him, or rather nothing at
all, but what himselfe re|membreth,
which is, that
hee liued in <HI>Traians</HI> time.
Coniecture propounds vn|to
vs, that hee was of the
<HI>Seneca's</HI> (that also is my
opinion) and so an <HI>Annaean</HI>
by line (that is, of the Spa|nish-house,
or family of
the <HI>Annaeans)</HI> and they
<PB REF="7">
who entitle him to bee of
the <HI>Iulij,</HI> haue also their
diuinatorie reasons. His
generous, bright, and
flowrie writings (the best
memoriall) are aliue, and
now translated into our
vulgar, with as much pro|prietie
as one Englishmans
English could attaine vn|to
for the present; but e|uery
where with a religi|ous
ayme to his meaning,
howsoeuer it may bee ma|ny
times mist, the diuersity
of Copies, like a change of
the marke, and the pecu|liar
manner of his stile like
a sudden blast comming
betweene. For this is true,
that there are in FLORVS
sundrie knots, not easie to
<PB REF="7">
vntie, while he, desirous to
speake quick, and close to|gether,
our vnderstanding
in him, wanteth roome as
it were, and that scope
which is, hath somewhat
thicke in it, amounting to
a clowdinesse:
<Q>&mdash;breuis esse laboro,
obscurus fio&mdash;</Q>
more perhaps, in this au|thor,
through corruption
of manuscripts, and Prints,
or of our duller-pointed
wits, then through his
fault, whose writings are
altogether as luminous,
as acuminons.</P>
<P>First, the names of men,<MILESTONE N="1">
nations, places, offices, and
things, peculiar to the <HI>Ro|mans,</HI>
need a particular in|terpreter,
<PB REF="8">
which this pocket-volume
will not handsomely
permit, at least-wise not in
present.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"> Secondly, the words which
are here and there inserted
in a different letter through
the text of <HI>Florus,</HI> are for
the most part explanatorie
of the authors meaning, sup|plying
marginall notes.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"> Thirdly, one elegancie,
which is almost perpetuall in
him, and answers to the first
similitude, in which hee fi|gures
the whole people of
<HI>Rome,</HI> in the person of a
<HI>MAN</HI> (as the frontispice
sheweth) it lost for the grea|ter
part, throughout the
translation, where the singu|lar
number sorts not so well,
<PB REF="8">
but breedes perplexitie, or
obscurenesse.</P>
<P>Fourthly, The doctrines <MILESTONE N="4">
which hee followes both in
<HI>Theologie,</HI> and moralitie,
and vpon which the fabricke
of his narrations standeth,
are such as thou art to expect
from an heathen, with whom
<HI>Polytheism,</HI> or pluralitie of
Gods, was an article of faith,
and among whom, <HI>selfe-kil|ling,</HI>
to auoid disgrace, see|med
an high point of true
magnanimitie, and the like,
which haue small danger in
them now, &amp; their <HI>examen</HI>
will else-where fall out fitly.</P>
<P>Fifthly, The numbers in <MILESTONE N="5">
the margine, signifie the
yeeres from <HI>Rome</HI> built,
which these letters, <HI>A. V. C.</HI>
<PB REF="9">
doe denotate, that is, <HI>An|no
Vrbis Conditae; in the
yeere of Rome Built,</HI> such,
or such. A discouerie not
worthy of any one, but onely
of them, who are nothing
else in a manner, but meere
English. Necessarie is it here
notwithstanding, for expla|nation
of the author, who (as
the frontispice, which (with
the helpe of the authors pre|face)
interprets it-selfe,
vnfoldeth) by a most exact,
and studied method of brief|nesse,
hath summ'd the whole
time of <HI>Rome</HI> in grosse, and
distributed it into ages, as
<HI>Lactatius Firmianus</HI> (vou|ching
I know not what <HI>Sene|ca</HI>
for it) and <HI>Ammianus
Marcellinus</HI> in his eigh|teenth
<PB REF="9">
booke, and <HI>lornan|des</HI>
an vsurper, and concea|ler
of <HI>Florus</HI> his wit) vnder
the I'mperour <HI>Iustinian.</HI></P>
<P>What the translatour
thinkes worthy of thy pre|cious
time, to knew further,
requires a large booke, ra|ther
then an Epistle, and
that also wil be but a briefe
vpon a briefe) of all the
old <HI>Roman</HI> wisedome ciuill,
and martiall, as here thou
hast of their facts. Enioy
this translation in the mean
time, and let not vnthank|fulnes
strangle any intend|ments
for thy more satisfa|ction,
nor shew thee igno|rant
of such a treasure, as
which, after aboue one
thousand foure hundred
<PB REF="10">
yeers co~tinuance (twice the
time of this storie) grow|ing
stronger in <HI>the</HI> world
by one language more then
his owne (when the <HI>Roman</HI>
empire it selfe (the subiect
of the booke) hath long
since in a manner come
to nothing) doth
giue great hope
that it is to be

<HEAD>THE
PREFACE
OF LVCIVS
FLORVS.</HEAD>
<P>_THE People of
<HI>Rome,</HI> from
King <HI>Romu|lus</HI>
to <HI>Caesar
Augustus,</HI> for the space of
seuen hundred yeeres, per|formed
so many noble deeds
both in peace, and warre,
that if a man compare the
magnitude of their empire
with the number of the
yeeres, hee will thinke it
<PB REF="12">
greater, then for the time.
They displayed their war|like
ensignes so farre, and
wide vpon the globe of the
earth, that such as reade
their performances, may
learne in them, not the acti|ons
of one people, but of all
mankind: For they were
tossed with so many labors,
and perils, that to establish
their empire, Vertue and
Fortune seeme to haue con|tended.
Which thing, though
it be also principally worth
the knowing; neuerthelesse,
for so much as the very
greatnesse it selfe is an im|pediment
to it selfe, and the
varietie of matter makes
the mind abruptly flit from
one thing to another;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aciem in|tentionis abrumpit.</NOTE> I will
<PB REF="12">
imitate them who draw the
maps of countreyes, and
comprehend the whole
image <HI>of that great Body,</HI>
within as it were a narrow
table: And in so doing,
my hopes are, that I shall
offer vp somewhat towards
the admirable honours of
the whole worlds soue|raigne
people, when toge|ther,
and <HI>yet distinctly</HI> in
it selfe, I shall aduance into
view their empires vni|uersall
greatnesse. Imagi|ning
therefore the <HI>whole</HI>
people of <HI>Rome</HI> were but
as one single person; and
<HI>then</HI> running ouer all their
time, thinke how they be|gan,
and how they grew
strong; then, how they at|tained
<PB REF="13">
to a certaine flower
as it were of youth, and
how in a sort they after|wards
waxed old, wee shall
therein find foure degrees,
or <HI>maine</HI> progressions.</P>
<P>The first reuolution was
vnder kings, for almost two
hundred and fiftie yeeres;
in which space they wrestled
and stroue about their Mo|ther-citie
with their neigh|bours.
This may be the
time of their infancie. The
following period, from the
Consulship of <HI>Brutus,</HI> and
<HI>Collatinus,</HI> to the Consul|ship
of <HI>Appius Claudius,</HI>
and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Marcus.</NOTE> <HI>Quintus Fuluius,</HI>
comprehends those two hun|dreth
and fiftie yeeres, in
which they subdued <HI>Italy.</HI>
<PB REF="13">
This was a time most fa|mous
for manhood, and
deeds of Cheualrie. It may
well be therefore tearmed
their youthfull age. From
hence, to <HI>Augustus Caesar,</HI>
are <HI>those other</HI> two hun|dreth
and fiftie yeeres, in
which he settled peace tho|row
all the world. And this
compasse of time is the very
Mans estate, and as it were
the strength and ripenesse of
the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. From
<HI>Augustus Caesar,</HI> to our
dayes, there haue not passed
many fewer then two hun|dreth
yeeres; in which,
through the vnworthinesse
of Emperours, the force <HI>of
the Roman people</HI> waxt
old, as it were, and wasted
<PB REF="14">
it selfe: sauing, that vn|der
the gouernment of <HI>Tra|ian,</HI>
their sinewes requicken,
and beyond all expectation,
the old age of the empire,
as if the youth thereof
were restored, growes
greene againe,
and flouri|sheth.</P>

child, confest of her selfe,
nor did fame long doubt
thereof, when <HI>Romulus,</HI> by
commaundement of <HI>Amu|lius,</HI>
throwne into the ri|uer,
together with his bro|ther
<HI>Remus,</HI> could not be
drowned. For the <HI>Genius</HI>
of <HI>Tiber</HI> both checkt down
his waters, and a shee|wolfe
following the crye
of the babes, left her yong
ones, and with her teats
discharged towards them
the office of a mother.
And in this plight, found
vnder a tree, <HI>Faustulus,</HI>
the kings shepheard con|ueyed
them to his farme|house,
and bred them vp.
<PB N="3" REF="15">
<HI>Alba,</HI> built by <HI>Iulius,</HI> was
then the chiefe citie of
<HI>Latium,</HI> which his father
<HI>Aeneas</HI> had reared. <HI>Amu|lius</HI>
was the foureteenth
king from these, and ex|pelled
his brother <HI>Numi|tor,</HI>
of whose daughter
<HI>Romulus</HI> was borne. Hee
therefore, in the first heats
of his youth, chased his
vncle <HI>Amulius</HI> out of the
royall seat, and restored
his grandfather; himselfe
delighting in the riuer,
and mountaines, among
which hee had beene edu|cated,
was busied in plot|ting
the walls of a new
towne. These brothers
were twinnes; and it was
therefore agreed betweene
<PB N="4" REF="16">
them, to make the gods
iudges, which of them
should first enter vpon the
gouernement and rule.
<HI>Remus</HI> tooke his stand vp|on
mount <HI>Auentine,</HI> and
<HI>Romulus</HI> vpon mount <HI>Pa|latine.</HI>
It was the fortune
of <HI>Remus</HI> to see birds first,
and they were sixe Vul|tures;
<HI>Romulus</HI> saw last,
but had twelue. So hauing
the vpper hand in this tri|all
by bird-flight, he builds
his citie, full of hope, that
it would proue a martiall
one; according as those
birds, accustomed to bloud
and rauine, did portend.
A<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vallum.</NOTE> trench and rampire
seemed sufficient to defend
the new citie; whose nar|rownesse
<PB N="5" REF="16">
while <HI>Remus</HI> de|rided,
and leapt ouer, in re|proofe
thereof, hee was
slaine; whether by his bro|thers
commandement, or
no, is doubtfull. Certaine
it is, that hee was the first
sacrifice, and consecrated
the new cities fortificati|on
with his bloud. There
wanted inhabitants. Neere
hand grew a groue, which
hee makes a place of san|ctuarie;
and thither a won|drous
companie of men
did forthwith flocke, some
of them <HI>Latins,</HI> some shep|heards
of <HI>Hetruria,</HI> and o|ther
of them some of those
beyond-sea <HI>Phrygians,</HI>
who were vnder <HI>Aeneas,</HI>
and of those <HI>Arcadians,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="17">
who hauing <HI>Euander</HI> for
their Generall, had come
flowing in. Thus of, as it
were diuerse elements he
gathered together one Bo|dy,
and himselfe composed
of them the <HI>Roman</HI> peo|ple.
This was a worke of
Time, the increase of in|habitants
was a worke of
Men. Therefore they
sought wiues from a|mong
the neighbours;
whom, when they could
not obtaine by suit, they
tooke by force. For they
pretending to make shews
and games on horsebacke,
the maids assembled <HI>from
parts about,</HI> to behold
them, were seised <HI>as law|full
pray.</HI> This ministred
<PB N="7" REF="17">
an occasion of present war.
The <HI>Veientes</HI> were beaten,
and put to flight. The <HI>Cae|ninensians</HI>
had their towne
taken, and rased; and king
<HI>Romulus,</HI> with his owne
hands, offered vp to <HI>Iupi|ter
Feretrius,</HI> the magnifi|cent
spoyles, which he had
gayned from his aduersa|rie
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Acron.</NOTE>King. The gates of
<HI>Rome</HI> were betraid to the
<HI>Sabines</HI> by a silly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Tarpeia.</NOTE> Virgin,
who had bargayned to
receiue for reward that
which they carryed on
their left hands, doubtfull,
whether shee meant their
shields, or bracelets. They
both to keepe their pro|mise,
and not to suffer her
to escape, ouer-whelmed
<PB N="8" REF="18">
her <HI>to death</HI> with their
shields. The enemies thus
getting to the walls, there
rose a terrible conflict in
the very entrance, so farre|forth,
that <HI>Romulus</HI> was
glad to beseech <HI>Ioue,</HI> to
flay his people from their
shamefull flying. In this
place there is a temple,
and <HI>the statue of</HI> IVPITER
<HI>the Stayer.</HI> At last, they
which had beene rauished,
came <HI>running-in</HI> tearing
their haire, betweene the
two armies, as they were
furiously encountring. So
was peace made with <HI>Ta|tius,</HI>
and a league ratified.
There ensued a matter
wonderfull to bee spoken.
The <HI>Sabine</HI> enemies lea|uing
<PB N="9" REF="18">
their ancient seate, re|moued
with their whole
families into the new ci|tie,
and share their horded
riches among their sonnes
in law for portions. Their
<HI>ioynt</HI> forces quickly en|creasing,
the most wise <HI>Ro|mulus</HI>
ordayned this forme
of common-weale. That
the young men, deuided
into tribes, should serue
on horse-back, and watch
in armour, to bee readie
for all sudden occasions of
warre: the councell of
estate should belong to
the old, and ancient, who
for their authoritie should
be called <HI>Fathers,</HI> and for
their antiquitie, <HI>Senators,</HI>
or <HI>Aldermen.</HI> These things
<PB N="10" REF="19">
thus established,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. V. C. XXXVIII.</NOTE> he was ta|ken
out of sight in a mo|ment,
as hee made an ora|tion
before the citie, at the
poole of <HI>Capra.</HI> Some
thinke he was torne in pie|ces
by the Senate, for his
harsh, and rough dispositi|on:
but a tempest rising
with an eclipse of the Sun,
made it seeme like the con|secration
of a God-head.
Which opinion, <HI>Iulius Pro|culus,</HI>
caused to go present|ly
currant, by affirming,
that <HI>Romulus</HI> had appea|red
to him in a more maie|sticall
shape, then euer hee
was seene before: that hee
commanded, they should
adore him as a power di|uine:
That the Gods had

should bee <HI>Quirinus:</HI>

to a short worke, and
the fortunes of both the
nations were entrusted to
a combat, betweene the
<HI>Horatij</HI> and <HI>Curatij,</HI> being
three to three of a side, and
brethren. The fight was
braue and doubtfull, and
admirable in the euent. For
<PB N="15" REF="21">
three of the one side being
wounded, and two of the
other slaine, that <HI>Horatius,</HI>
who remayned aliue, hel|ping
out his valour with
his wit, faynes himselfe to
flie, so to single forth the
enemie, and then turning
vpon each as they were
able to follow, ouer-came
them all. So (which was o|therwise
a rare glorie) the
victorie was gotten with
one mans hand, which hee
forth with stained by parri|cide.
Hee saw his sister
weepe at the sight of the
<HI>conquered</HI> spoiles he wore,
being her betrothed hus|band's,
though an enemies.
Which vnseasonable ten|der-heartednesse
he reuen|ged
<PB N="16" REF="22">
with sheathing his
sword in her. For this hay|nous
fact, hee was arraig|ned.
But the merit of his
man-hood preserued the
offendor from danger, and
the crime was hidden with
in his valours glorie. Nor
did the <HI>Albanes</HI> long keepe
their faith. For, being sent
as aydes, and fellowes in
armes against the <HI>Fide|nates,</HI>
according to the ar|ticles
of their league, they
turned neutrall in battell
<HI>for their owne aduantage.</HI>
But the politike king, <HI>Ho|stilius,</HI>
so soone as hee saw
his associates incline to the
enemies partie, he gathers
fresh spirit, as if hee had
willed them so to doe;
<PB N="17" REF="22">
which did put hope into

came to nothing. The

his wife <HI>Tullia</HI> of any bet|ter

For hurrying to salute her

her amazed Coach-horse

raging with slaughter a|gainst

<PB N="26" REF="27">
Then turned hee cruell

that <HI>thereupon</HI> counterfei|ting
himselfe a fugitiue, he
might gayne credit with

he <HI>only</HI> strucke off the tops

was all the answere which
his pride vouchsafed. Ne|uerthelesse,

he built a tem|ple

a diuine instinct, being
throughly all of them re|solued
to restore them|selues
to libertie, and se|cure
the honor of their

from the king, spoile his

ground to <HI>Mars,</HI> and trans|ferre
the soueraigne power
to the same men, who had
beene founders of their
freedome, but yet change|ing
both the iudge, &amp; title.
For it was agreed, that
whereas the authoritie had
<HI>before</HI> beene single, and
perpetuall; it should bee
now <HI>but</HI> from yeere to
yeere, and bipartite, lest
either by singularitie, or
continuance it should bee
corrupted: and for kings
they styled them Consuls,
that they might remem|ber
<HI>the dutie of their place

for their Countrey.
Such ioy was conceiued
<PB N="34" REF="31">
for this new freedome, that
they could hardly beleeue
the change, and one of the
Consuls, because he was of
kingly name, and race, they
depriued him of his of|fice,
and banished him the
citie. Into whose roome
<HI>Valerius Poplicola</HI> being
substituted, hee bent his
whole studies to augment
the free maiessie of the
people. For hee bowed
downe <HI>to them</HI> the <HI>Fasces</HI>
in their assemblie, and
made it lawfull to appeale
from the Consuls to the
people. And that the shew
of a seeming castle might
not offend, he pluckt down
his house which stood
high, &amp; built it on a flat, or
<PB N="35" REF="31">
leuel. But <HI>Brutus</HI> to come
with all his sailes into po|pularitie,
did both cast
his house to the ground,
and slue his sonnes. For
hauing discouer'd, that
they practised to bring in
kings againe, he drew them
forth into the <HI>Forum,</HI> and
in the mid'st of the assem|blie,
scourged them <HI>first</HI>
with rods, and <HI>then</HI> cut off
their heads with the axe:
so that he plainly seemed,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Gallick warre.</HEAD>
<P>_AFter this, either by
the enuie of the
Gods, or by desti|nie,
the most round quick
streame of spredding do|minion,
was for a while
kept vnder by the ouer|flowings
of the <HI>Galli Seno|nes.</HI>
Which season, it is
hard to say, whether it were
more dismall to the <HI>Roman</HI>
people through terrible
calamities, or glorious for
the proofes they gaue of
their manhood. Certaine it
is, that the violence of
their extremes was such, as
I may <HI>well</HI> think they were
<PB N="54" REF="41">
sent from heauen of pur|pose;
the immortall Gods
desirous to try, whether
the vertue of the <HI>Romanes</HI>
might deserue the empire
of the world. These <HI>Galli
Senones,</HI> a nation natural|ly
fierce, of a wilde beha|uiour,
their bodies huge
aswell as their warre-like
weapons, were in all re|spects
so dreadfull, as they
seemed no other then
borne to destroy man|kinde
and beate downe ci|ties.
In former ages,
when the <HI>Ocean</HI> had sur|rounded
all, they com|ming
in an huge plumpe
from the vtmost coasts
of the earth, when they
<HI>first</HI> had wasted what was
<PB N="55" REF="41">
in their way, and <HI>then</HI> sea|ted
themselues betweene
the <HI>Alpes,</HI> and <HI>Po,</HI> nor <HI>yet</HI>
contented there, they wan|dred
also ouer <HI>Italie.</HI> They
lay now at siege before
<HI>Clusium.</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> be|came
intercessours, as for
their fellowes, and confe|derates.
Ambassadors were
sent, as the manner is: But
what regard hath right, <HI>or
wrong,</HI> among the barba|rous?
They carrie them|selues
roughly; and trans|ferre
the quarrell, from
thence. Rising therefore
from before <HI>Clusium,</HI> and
comming to <HI>Rome,</HI> the
Consull <HI>Fabius</HI> giues them
battell with an armie, at
the riuer <HI>Alia.</HI> The dis|comfiture
<PB N="56" REF="42">
at <HI>Cremera</HI> was
not more piteous. The
<HI>Romans</HI> therefore marke
this day among their black
ones. Our forces defea|ted,
they forthwith ap|proch
the walls of <HI>Rome.</HI>
There was no garrison.
Then, or else neuer, did the
<HI>Roman</HI> brauerie of minde
appeare. For, so soone as
might be, such of the Se|natours,
as had borne high|est
offices, assemble in the
<HI>Forum,</HI> and vnder the cur|ses
of the chiefe Priest,
banne, and deuoue them|selues,
<HI>for their Countries
safetie,</HI> to the gods infer|nall:
and, <HI>those dire cere|monies
ended,</HI> they were
each of them immediately
<PB N="57" REF="42">
put backe againe to their
houses, <HI>before which,</HI> they
seated themselues vpon
their Court-chaires, appa|relled
in their robes of
state, and most honourable
habiliments, that when the
enemie came vpon them,
they might die in the ma|iestie
of their places. The
Priests, and Flamines, did
partly packe vp, in dry|fats,
whatsoeuer was most
religiously esteemed of, in
their temples, couering
them vnder ground, and
partly trussed into carts,
transporting it away with
themselues. The Virgins
also of <HI>Vesta's</HI> colledge did
bare-foot accompany their
flying gods. At which
<PB N="58" REF="43">
time, <HI>Albinius,</HI> one of the
common people, is said to
haue taken his wife &amp; chil|dren
out of their waggon,
and placed those virgins
there. So that euen in
those dayes the religion of
the State was more deare
vnto vs, then priuate affe|ction.
Such as were able
to beare armes, whose
number was scarce sixe
thousand, followed <HI>Man|lius,</HI>
for captaine, vp into
the <HI>Capitoll,</HI> praying high
<HI>Ioue,</HI> as if he were euen pre|sent
then among them,
that as they were flockt
together for defence of his
temple, so he <HI>againe</HI> would
protest their valour vnder
his title. Meane while the
<PB N="59" REF="43">
<HI>Galls</HI> come, at first as men
amazed, finding the gate
wide open, suspitious of
some plot: but when they
found all hush, they enter
disorderly, with no lesse a
cry, then furie. They goe
to the houses, whose dores
stood euery-where open;
and when they beheld the
purple-cloathed Senatours
sitting in their chayres of
state, they worshipt them
<HI>at first</HI> as gods, or locall
Ghosts: but so soone as
it appeared they were
mortall men, and that o|therwise
they disdained to
answer, they straightwayes
did <HI>as</HI> absurdly sacrifice, <HI>as
adore</HI> them; burne buil|dings,
&amp; with fire-brands,
<PB N="60" REF="44">
yron tooles, and force of
hands, lay the whole citie
as low as the soile it stood
vpon. Seuen months (who
would beleeue it?) the bar|barous
houered about one
hill, hauing not onely by
day, but by night, assayed
all meanes to force it:
whom, when at last they
were mounted vp in the
darke, <HI>Manlius</HI> wakened
with the creaking of a
goose, threw headlong
backe from the top of the
cragge: and to put the e|nemie
out of all hope <HI>of
staruing them,</HI> hurled
loaues of bread from the
castle, to make a show of
confidence, though their
famine was extreme. And
<PB N="61" REF="44">
vpon a certaine set day hee
sent forth <HI>Fabius,</HI> through
the middest of the enemies
guards, to performe a so|lemne
sacrifice vpon mount
<HI>Quirinal:</HI> who, by the
<HI>meere</HI> awe of religion, re|turned
vntoucht through
the thickest of the leaguers
weapons, and brought assu|rance
backe, that they had
the gods their friends. At
last, when the barbarous
were tyred now with their
owne siege, contented to
sell their departure at a
thousand pound weight of
gold, and then also putting
in a sword ouer and aboue
their bargaine, into the
false ballances <HI>they weighed
by,</HI> insolently iustifying it
<PB N="62" REF="45">
by this cutting quippe, <HI>Woe
to them who are ouercome,
L. Camillus</HI> suddenly as|sayles
them at their backs,
and made such slaughter
<HI>among them,</HI> that all the
characters of destruction,
which fire had printed in
the citie, were blotted out
with the inundations of
the bloud of the <HI>Galls.</HI>
We may well giue thanks
to the immortall gods in
the behalfe it selfe of so
great a calamitie. That fire
and flame which destroyed
<HI>Rome,</HI> buried the pouertie
of <HI>Romulus.</HI> For what o|ther
thing else did that
burning, but prouide, that
the citie which the Fates
ordained to be the mansion
<PB N="63" REF="45">
seat of men, &amp; gods, might
not seeme to haue beene
consumed, or ouer-whel|med,
but hallowed, and
expiated rather? There|fore,
after <HI>Rome</HI> was thus
defended by <HI>Manlius,</HI> and
deliuered by <HI>Camillus,</HI> it
rose vp against bordering
nations more eagerly and
vehemently then before.
And to begin at those very
<HI>Galls</HI> themselues, shee, not
satisfied with hauing dri|uen
them out, beyond her

her the ruines of countries,

by this time the feare con|ceiued
of the elephants
was worne away, and <HI>Ca|ius</HI>
Minucius, a speare in
the fourth legion, cutting
<PB N="84" REF="56">
one of their trunkes off,
had made it appeare, that
they were mortall. There|fore,
the iauelins were dar|ted
thicke at them also:
and firebrands hurld into
the towres, ouerwhelm'd
all the aduersaries squa|drons
with the fall of their
burning workes: nor was
there any other end of the
ouerthrow, but that
which night made by par|ting;
king <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> him|selfe,
last of them who
fled, being wounded in the
shoulder, was borne a|way
armed, by his guard.
The last battell was in <HI>Lu|cania,</HI>
neere the fields
which they call <HI>Aurusin,</HI>
vnder the same Generals,
<PB N="85" REF="56">
as before. And that e|uent
which vertue was a|bout
to haue giuen heere,
for an vpshot, or clozing
victorie, fortune gaue.
For the elephants being
brought againe into the
vantgard, one of them a
yong one, being grieuously
wounded in the head with
a weapon,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">auertit.</NOTE> turn'd taile:
and as in flying, it rusht
thorow, ouer the bodies
of friends, and bemoned
it selfe in braying, the dam
knew it, and as it were to
take reuenge for her foale,
started out <HI>of her ranke;</HI>
then filled all with feare, &amp;
affright round about, no o|therwise
then as if they
had been her aduersaries: so
<PB N="86" REF="57">
the same beasts which car|ried
away the first day
cleere, and made the se|cund
indifferent, gaue a|way
the third past contro|uersie.
But the warre with
king <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> was not in
the fields abroad with for|ces
onely, but with wit al|so,
and at home within the
citie. For the cunning
prince, after hee had obtai|ned
the first victory, hauing
well felt what manner of
men hee had to deale with
in the <HI>Romans,</HI> despaired
to preuaile by force, &amp; be|tooke
himselfe to deuices.
For hee burnt the slaine,
vsed his prisoners louingly,
and sent them home free
without ransome. And in
<PB N="87" REF="57">
the necke of that, dispatch|ing
ambassadours to <HI>Rome,</HI>
labour'd by all possible
meanes to be admitted as a
friend. But the <HI>Roman</HI> ver|tue
approued it selfe then
for excellent, in warre, and
peace, abroad, &amp; at home,
in all points: neither did e|uer
any victorie rather
show the valour of the peo|ple,
the high wisdome of
the <HI>Senate,</HI> and the magna|nimity&punc;
slenders, then the
<HI>Tarentine.</HI> What kind of
men were trampled to
death in the first battell by
the elephants? all their
wounds were forward,
some found dead vpon
their enemies bodies, in e|uery
mans hand his sword,
<PB N="88" REF="58">
threatnings left vpon their
browes, and anger liuing in
death it selfe. Which <HI>Pyr|rhus</HI>
so admired, that hee
said, <HI>O how easie were it for
mee, to become lord of the
world, if I were captaine of
the</HI> Roman <HI>souldiers, or
for the</HI> Romans, <HI>had they
mee for their king!</HI> And
what speed made they
who suruiued the first o|uerthrow,
in renforceing
their powers? when <HI>Pyr|rhus</HI>
said; I see as sure as can
bee, that I am borne vnder
the constellation of <HI>Her|cules,</HI>
for that so many
more heads as I haue slain,
spring out of their owne
bloud, as it were out of
<HI>Lernas</HI> serpent. And what
<PB N="89" REF="58">
a <HI>Senate</HI> was that? when
vpon the oration of <HI>Appi|us</HI>
the <HI>Blinde,</HI> the kings
ambassadours who were
sent backe out of the citie
with their gifts and pre|sents,
confest to <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI>
vpon his demand of what
they thought concerning
the enemies seat, <HI>that the
citie seemed a temple, the
Senate a parliament of
kings.</HI> Againe, what man|ner
of men were the Ge|nerals
themselues in camp?
when <HI>Curius</HI> sent the kings
physician back, who made
offer <HI>in secret,</HI> for a certain
summe to poyson him,
and <HI>Fabricius,</HI> hauing the
choise giuen <HI>by Pyrrhus,</HI>
refused to share a king|dome
<PB N="90" REF="59">
with him. Or what
were they in time of peace?
when <HI>Curius</HI> preferred his
earthen dishes before the
<HI>Samnits</HI> gold; and <HI>Fabri|cius,</HI>
vsing Censorian seue|ritie,
condemn'd it for rio|tous
in <HI>Rufinus,</HI> a Consula|rie
nobleman, because hee
had siluer plate, in all to a
tenne pound weight. Who
wonders now, if the people
of <HI>Rome,</HI> with such quali|ties,
courages, and martiall
discipline, obtained victory;
or that by this one <HI>Taren|tine</HI>
warre they should in
foure yeeres space bring
into subiection <HI>(as they
did)</HI> the greatest part of all
<HI>Italy,</HI> most puissant nati|ons,
most rich common|weals,
<PB N="91" REF="59">
&amp; most fertill coun|treys?
Or what doth so
much surpasse beliefe, as
when you compare the
beginnings of the warre
with the conclusion? <HI>Pyr|rhus,</HI>
conquerour in the
first field, harrased tremb|ling
<HI>Italy, Campania, Liris,</HI>
and <HI>Fregellae,</HI> came within
ken of <HI>Rome,</HI> then almost
taken, as he beheld it from
the castell of <HI>Praeneste,</HI> and
within twentie miles off,
filled the eyes of the qua|king
citie with smoak, and
dust. The same prince, en|forced
twice <HI>after that</HI> to
quit his campe, twice
wounded, and beaten ouer
land, and sea, into his

<PB N="92" REF="60">
quiet, and the spoiles,
which were gotten from
so many the richest nati|ons,
so infinite, as <HI>Rome</HI>
was not wide enough to
containe her owne victo|rie.
For there neuer en|tred
a more glittering, or
more goodly triumph, be|cause
before this time, shee
had beheld nothing but
the cattell of the <HI>Volsci|ans,</HI>
the heards of the <HI>Sa|bins,</HI>

when they saw within kenn

they burnt with so ex|treme
a desire of atchie|uing
<PB N="112" REF="70">
it, that whereas they
could not come at it by
bridges, nor shut out the
sea, they were resolute to
vnite it to their dominion

the destinies willing to o|pen

wanted not a <HI>wished</HI> occa|sion,

the conquest of <HI>Sicilia,</HI> as
well as the <HI>Romans,</HI> both
of them at the same time,
and with equall affections,
and forces, hauing in pro|iect
the lordship of the

<PB N="113" REF="70">
their associates, that
was the colour, but in very
deed spurred on with loue
of the prey (though the
newnesse of the attempt
troubled them, yet valour
is so full of confidence)
this rude, this shepheardish
people, and meere land|men,
did <HI>well</HI> shew, that
manhood made no diffe|rence
whether it fought
on horse-back, or on ship|boord,
vpon the earth, or
waters. <HI>Appius Clau|dius,</HI>
Consul, they first
aduentured into those
streights which had beene
made hideous with po&euml;|ticall
monsters, and where
the current was violent;
but they were so farre
<PB N="114" REF="71">
from being deterred there|by,
that they made vse of
the furie of the hurrying
tide as of a fauour: <HI>for fal|ling
in therewith,</HI> they
forthwith set vpon <HI>Hiero,</HI>
king of <HI>Syracuse,</HI> with such
celeritie, that himselfe con|fest
hee found himselfe o|uercome
before hee saw
the enemy. <HI>Duilius,</HI> and
<HI>Cornelius,</HI> Consuls, they
durst also fight at sea. And
the speed then vsed to
build, and rigge a nauie
was certainely a signe of
speeding. For within three|score
dayes after the tim|ber
was fell'd, an <HI>armada</HI>
of one hundred and three|score
saile, ridde at anchor
<HI>out of it;</HI> so that they see|med
<PB N="115" REF="71">
not the worke of ship|wrights,
but as if by a kind
of metamorphosis, the
gods had turned them
such, and changed trees to
vessels. But the report
which goes of the fight is
maruelous, where these
slugges, and heauie bot|tomes
seized vpon the
quick and nimble nauie of
the aduersaries, who were
much more cunning at sea,
so farre as skill to shift aside
oares, and to dally out the
strokes of beake-heads, by
yare, and readie turning.
For the hands of yron, and
other the <HI>grappling</HI> engines
of the <HI>Romans,</HI> the enemie
made much sport at, before
the battels ioyned; but
<PB N="116" REF="72">
were then compelled to
trie it out <HI>in good earnest,</HI>
as if they had fought on
firme land. Thus giuing
the ouerthrow at the Iles
of <HI>Liparae,</HI> their enemies ar|mada
either sunke, or fled,
this was their first sea-tri|umph.
The ioy whereof,
how great was it? when
<HI>Duilius,</HI> Captaine generall
in that seruice, not thinking
one daies triumph enough,
did neuer come home from
any supper, so long as hee
liued, but hee would haue
torches borne lighted, and
flutes play before him, as if
hee triumphed euery day.
The losse, in regard of so
great a victorie, was but
light. The other of the
<PB N="117" REF="72">
Consuls, <HI>Cnaeus Cornelius
Asina,</HI> entrapt by the ene|mie,
vnder colour of par|ley,
&amp; so surprised, became
a lesson against giuing cre|dit

from a ground of aduan|tage,
<PB N="118" REF="73">
which hee had taken,

and warre crept farther,
crost ouer into <HI>Sardinia,</HI>

<PB N="119" REF="73">
the inhabitants, by ra|sing
the citie <HI>Carala,</HI> and so
vanquisht all the <HI>Carthagi|nians,</HI>
or <HI>Paenish-men,</HI> as
well by land, as sea, that
nothing now was left to be
conquered, but <HI>Africa</HI> it

sayled with warre a|boord
him into <HI>Africa.</HI> Yet
there wanted not some,
who fainted at the terrible
name which the <HI>Carthagi|nian</HI>

the tribune also, aug|menting
<HI>by his feare</HI> this
fearfull conceit, till the Ge|nerall
menacing him with
the naked axe, vnlesse hee
obeyed, made him take
heart, and put to sea, for
feare of his head. They
<PB N="120" REF="74">
forthwith plyde it with
oare &amp; saile: and the feare
of our comming was such
among the <HI>Paenish-men,</HI>
that <HI>Carthage</HI> had almost
set open her gates, and been
taken. The first reward of
this martiall voyage was
the taking of the citie <HI>Cly|pea</HI>
(for that stands first in
sight vpon the <HI>Punick</HI> shore
like a fort, and sentinell)
and aboue three hundred
castles, besides the same,
were sackt, and rased. Nor
fought they only with men
but with monsters also; for
a serpent of prodigious big|nesse,
and bred as it were to
take vengeance on behalfe
of <HI>Africa,</HI> vext our campe
at <HI>Bagrada.</HI> But <HI>Regulus,</HI>
<PB N="121" REF="74">
who conquerd all things,
hauing spred the terrour of
his name farre, and neare,
multitudes of their youth
slaine, their captaines dead
at his foot, or fast in chains,
his nauie fraighted with in|finite
spoiles, which he had
sent heauie laden away to
<HI>Rome,</HI> as stuffe for triumph,
laid siege to the chiefe seate
of that warre, <HI>Carthage</HI> it|selfe,
and lodged close at
the very gates. Here for|tune
wheeld about a little,
only that <HI>Rome</HI> might haue
the more glories to adorne
it, whose greatnesse is for
the more part most impro|ued
by great mischances.
For the enemies turning
themselues to make vse of
<PB N="122" REF="75">
forreine aids, the <HI>Lacedemo|nians</HI>
sent them <HI>Xantippus</HI>
for a Generall, who being
most expert in the Art of
warre, gaue vs a grieuous o|uerthrow,
&amp; the most stout
<HI>Regulus</HI> himselfe (a misfor|tune
which had neuer hap|ned
to the <HI>Romans</HI> before)
fell aliue into the enemies
hands. But he was a man a|ble
to beare so great a di|stresse:
For his mind could
neither be conquered by
imprisonment, nor with the
message he vndertooke; be|cause,
quite contrary to that
which hee had in charge
from the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> he
deliuered his opinion <HI>in the</HI>
Roman <HI>Senate,</HI> That they
should not make peace, nor
<PB N="123" REF="75">
yeeld exchange of prisoners.
But neither was the maiesty
of the man embased by vo|luntarie
returne to the foe,
<HI>in discharge of his honour,</HI>
nor finally, by captiuitie,
nor by nayling on a gibbet
for punishment: nay, all
these things increased the
admiration of him. For what
other thing was all this else,
then that the vanquisht did
triumph ouer the vanqui|shers;
and though not ouer
<HI>Carthage,</HI> yet ouer fortunes
selfe? And the <HI>Romans</HI> were
more eager, &amp; more offen|siuely
bent to take reuenge
for <HI>Regulus,</HI> then to co~passe
victory. The <HI>Carthaginians</HI>
therfore bearing their crests
aloft, &amp; the warre comming
<PB N="124" REF="76">
back into <HI>Sicilia, Metellus</HI>
Consul made such a slaugh|ter
of the enemie at <HI>Panor|mus,</HI>
that there was no more
stirre in that Iland. An ar|gument
of a most braue day
gained, was the seisure of an
hundred and twentie ele|phants:
a great prey, had
such an heard been gotten,
not by warre, but by hun|ting.
<HI>Publius Claudius</HI> Con|sull,
the <HI>Romans</HI> were ouer|come,
not by the enemie,
but by the Gods the~selues,
whose ceremonies they had
contemned, their nauie
forthwith sinking in the

<PB N="125" REF="76">
<HI>Marcus Fabius Buteo,</HI> Con|sul,
met the enemies nauie
in the <HI>African</HI> sea, about

ouerthrew it. O how great
a triumph perished vtterly
at that time, by stresse of

nauie, yare, light, vnincum|bred,

The enemies vessels there|fore
torne to pieces in a

So exceeding great

<P>_FOure yeeres were
scarcely now o|uerpast
after the
first <HI>Carthaginian</HI> warre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. V. C. DXXXV.</NOTE>
when lo, another <HI>brake
forth,</HI> lesse in respect of the
time (for it lasted not a|boue
eighteene yeeres)
but so farre beyond the
former in respect of terri|ble
ouerthrowes, that if a
man compare the losse
together, which both
the sides sustained, hee
would rather thinke the
victors part to bee the
partie vanquished. The
<PB N="137" REF="82">
noble <HI>Carthaginians</HI> were
ashamed, seeing them|selues
thrust out of the
seas possession, and their
Ilands violently taken
from them, and they to
pay tribute, who were
wont to impose it. Here|vpon
<HI>Annibal,</HI> then a boy,
bound himselfe by oath to
his father before the altar,
to take reuenge; wherein
hee was not slacke. There|fore
to beget matter for a
warre, he razed <HI>Saguntus</HI> to
the ground, an ancient
rich citie of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and a
great, but grieuous moni|ment
of her truth, and faith
to the <HI>Romans;</HI> whose
freedome being by name
prouided for in the gene|rall
<PB N="138" REF="83">
<HI>articles</HI> of league, <HI>An|nibal</HI>
seeking causes of new
quarrels, ouerthrew to the
ground, with his owne, and
others hands, that by
breach of peace hee might
open <HI>Italy</HI> for himselfe.
The <HI>Romans</HI> make not a
greater conscience of any
thing then of keeping the
faith of leagues. Vpon ad|uertisement
therefore that
their confederate citie was
besieged, they did not pre|sently
runne to their wea|pons,
but did rather first
choose to assay by way of
orderly complaint, what
amends could bee had, as
remembring they were al|so
in amity with <HI>Carthagi|nians.</HI>
Meane-while the
<PB N="139" REF="83">
<HI>Saguntines</HI> tired with hun|ger,
batteries, assaults, and
fire, and their constancie
turning into madnesse, and
furie, they make a mon|strous
funerall pile in the
most open space of their ci|tie;
and laying then them|selues,
and their whole sub|stance
on the top thereof&punc;
made an end of all toge|ther
with sword, and fire.
For this so foule a destru|ction,
the <HI>Romans</HI> deman|ded
the deliuerie vp of
<HI>Annibal.</HI> But the <HI>Cartha|ginians</HI>
paltring in the case,
quoth <HI>Fabius,</HI> the chiefe
ambassadour of the <HI>Ro|mans,</HI>
What meanes this
delay? lo, in this lappe I
bring you war, and peace,
<PB N="140" REF="84">
choose which of them you
like best, and take it among
you. And when at these
words the voice went
round, hee should giue
them at his pleasure, which
he would; Bee it war then,
said he; and therewithall
flinging open the skirts of
his robe, in the midst of
the Counsel-house, which
hee had gather'd hollow,
and held vp till then, hee
did it with such an horrour
as if hee had indeed powr'd
warre among them out of
his lap, or bosome. The end
of this war was sutable to
the beginning. For as if
the last curses of the <HI>Sa|guntines</HI>
in that their pub|like
self-slaughter, &amp; finall
<PB N="141" REF="84">
fire had commanded such
obsequies to bee celebra|ted,
their ghosts were sa|crificed
vnto with the de|uastation
of <HI>Italy,</HI> the cap|tiuitie
of <HI>Africa,</HI> and the
destruction of kings and
Generals of armies, by
whom that warre was ma|naged.
When as therefore
that sad, and dismall storm,
and tempest of the <HI>Cartha|ginian</HI>
warre once stirring
in <HI>Spaine,</HI> had forged out
of the <HI>Saguntine</HI> fires, those
lightnings, and thunders,
now long in breeding, and
aim'd at <HI>Rome,</HI> immediate|ly
then, as carryed with a
whirl-winde, it rusht tho|row
the middle of the
<HI>Alps,</HI> and fell vpon <HI>Italy</HI>
<PB N="142" REF="85">
from the snowie toppe of
those mountaines made
higher then they were <HI>of
themselues</HI> by fame, and fa|bles,
as if it had beene from
heauen. The first rages of
the charge burst streight|way
forth with horrible
violence, betweene the ri|uer
of <HI>Po,</HI> and <HI>Ticinum.</HI>
There, <HI>Scipio</HI> Generall,
the <HI>Roman</HI> army was put
to flight, and the Generall
himselfe had falne woun|ded
as hee was, into the
hands of the enemy, if his
sonne, then wanting of
eighteene yeeres old, had
not rescued his father from
certaine death it selfe with

After this ouerthrow
at <HI>Ticinum</HI> followed that
of <HI>Trebia.</HI> This second
storme of warre wrought
the furious effects thereof,
<HI>Sempronius</HI> Consul. There
the craftie enemies, in a

at fires, and suppled
their limbs with oyle, men
(a wonder to bee spoken)
co~ming out of the South,

lake, <HI>Flaminius our</HI> Ge|nerall.
There also, the <HI>Car|thaginians</HI>
vented another
new trick of their trade. For
the lake lying hidde~ vnder
a thick mist, the cauallerie
shadowed from sight with
twigs, &amp; <HI>long</HI> osiars which
grew in the marsh, gaue a
sudde~ charge vpon our rere.
Neuerthelesse wee cannot
blame the enemie, <HI>but our
selues. For</HI> swarms <HI>of bees</HI>
which clustred vpo~ the <HI>Ro|ma~</HI>
ensigns, their <HI>gilt</HI> eagles
vnwilling to come out, and
an huge earthquake at the
ioyning of the battels, <HI>all of
the~ vnlucky signes,</HI> had fore|warned
our rash Generall
of the euent, <HI>and preuented
it,</HI> but that the concourse
<PB N="145" REF="86">
of the horse, &amp; foot, &amp; the
extraordinary lowd clash|ing
of their weapons gaue
<HI>to Flaminius</HI> alone the ho|nor
of leading them on, <HI>a|gainst
the other Consuls li|king.</HI>
The fourth, &amp; the al|most
deadly wound of the
empire was at <HI>Cannae,</HI> an
obscure village of <HI>Apulia,</HI>
but through the greatnesse
of the blow which was re|ceiued
there, it got to be fa|mous
at the cost of fortie
thousand liues. In that
place the General himselfe,
earth, heauen, the day, and
all things else consented to
the fall of that vnfortunate
army. For <HI>Annibal</HI> not con|tent
to haue put counter|feit
fugitiues vpon vs, who
<PB N="146" REF="87">
<HI>seeing their vantage,</HI> forth|with
set vpon our men at
their backs, but that most
dangerous captaine hauing
moreouer in the open
fields, markt the nature of
the place where the sunne|beams
did beat hottest, the
dust was infinite, and the
easterne winde blew stint
as it were, he so marshall'd
his battels, that the <HI>Romans</HI>
standing with their faces
towards all these disad|uantages,
himselfe had the
whole fauour of the skie,
the winde, the dust, &amp; sun
at once to fight for him.
The enemies therfore were
so glutted with the execu|tion
of two most mighty
hosts, that <HI>Annibal</HI> himself
<PB N="147" REF="87">
bade his souldiers, <HI>spare the
sword.</HI> Of the two Consuls,
the one fled, the other was
slaine; hard to say, whether
of them the more braue
therein. <HI>Aemilius</HI> ashamed
<HI>to suruiue, Varro</HI> despaired
not <HI>of better.</HI> Signes of the
greatnes of the ouerthrow
were these, the riuer <HI>Aufi|dus</HI>
ran bloud for a while,
a bridge of dead carcases
made at <HI>Annibals</HI> comma~|deme~t
ouer <HI>Gellus</HI> brooke,
two bushels of gold rings
sent to <HI>Carthage,</HI> and the
estimate of <HI>Roman</HI> gentle|men
slaine, calculated not
by tale, but measure. It was
then past all doubt, that
<HI>Rome</HI> had seene her last
day, &amp; that <HI>Annibal,</HI> with|in
<PB N="148" REF="88">
fiue dayes, might haue
feasted in the Capitol, if (as
the <HI>Carthaginian, Mahar|bal,
Bumilcar's</HI> sonne, is re|ported
to haue said) <HI>Anni|bal</HI>
had as well vnder|stood
how to make vse of
his victory, as how to ob|taine
it. But, as the com|mon
voice goeth, either
the fate of <HI>Rome</HI> ordain'd
to bee empresse of the
earth, or <HI>Annibals</HI> euill
<HI>Genius,</HI> or the Gods of <HI>Car|thage</HI>
now auerted, carried
him a diuerse way. <HI>For</HI>
when hee might haue put
his victory home, he rather
made choise to enioy it, &amp;
suffred <HI>Rome</HI> to rest, while
hee progrest to <HI>Campania,</HI>
&amp; <HI>Tarent,</HI> where both he,
<PB N="149" REF="88">
and his armie lost, by, and
by their spirit so, as it was
truly said, that <HI>Capua</HI> was
<HI>Annibals Cannae.</HI> For him
whom neither the <HI>Alps,</HI>
nor force of armes could
daunt, <HI>Campania</HI> alone, and
the delicate warme springs
of <HI>Baiae</HI> did (who would
beleeue it?) subdue. Mean|while
the <HI>Romans</HI> tooke
breath, and rise as it were
from death to life againe.
Weapons wanted: they
tooke them downe out of
the temples. Fresh souldi|ers
wanted: they minister
the oath of warre to their
bondmen, and make them
free. Treasure wanted: the
lords of the counsell bring
gladly all they had, leauing
<PB N="150" REF="89">
no gold to themselues,
but what was in their
brooches, belts, and rings:
the knights, and gentle|men
followed the Sena|tours
example, and the
comoners the gentlemens:
to bee briefe, <HI>Leuinus,</HI> and
<HI>Marcellus</HI> Consuls, such a|bundance
of riches was
brought <HI>together</HI> out of
priuate contributions for
the publike seruice, that the
eschequer had scarcely
bookes, and clerks enow
to enter the particulars.
What shall we say of them
<HI>at this time,</HI> in the choise of
magistrats? how great was
the wisdome of the centu|ries,
or hundred-men, when
the yonger sort askt cou~sel
<PB N="151" REF="89">
of the ancient, whom they
should nominate for Con|suls?
For it stood them vp|on,
not to deale with faire
force onely against so cun|ning
an enemie, who had so
often beaten them, but to
meet with him also in his
owne policies. The first
hope of their empires re|couerie,
and, as I may say,
reuiuall thereof, was <HI>Fa|bius,</HI>
who inuented a new
method of vanquishing <HI>A|nibal,
Not to fight.</HI> And
from hence it was, that in
happie time for <HI>Rome</HI> hee
got the nick-name, to bee
called, <HI>The draw-backe,</HI> or
<HI>Cunctator:</HI> and from hence

vpon his backe in his re|treat;
though, O the shame!
the <HI>Romans</HI> were compel|led
<PB N="153" REF="90">
to fight with the hands
of their bondslaues. O the
horrible confidence of a
people, among so many
aduersities! O the high
haughtinesse, and brauerie
of their spirit, in their so
extreme &amp; afflicted estate,
that being doubtfull of kee|ping
<HI>Italy,</HI> they durst not|withstanding
tend to other
places; and when their e|nemies
flew vp and downe
at their throats, ouer all
<HI>Campania,</HI> and <HI>Apulia,</HI> and
made halfe <HI>Afrike</HI> in <HI>Italie,</HI>
did both at one time beare
the brunt of his assaults,
and at the same time dis|patched
forces into <HI>Sicilia,
Sardinia, Spaine,</HI> and other
parts of the world. <HI>Marcel|lus</HI>
<PB N="154" REF="91">
was sent into <HI>Sicilia,</HI>
which held not out long:
for the power of the whole

one citie. <HI>Syracusae,</HI> that
great, and till that time, vn|conquered
chiefe-towne,
though defended by the

yeeld at last. Her treble

her hauen of marble,
and her fountaine <HI>Arethu|sa,</HI>
so farre renowned, what
auayled they other then
thus farre onely, that the

nor the monstrous
cragges of their <HI>mad</HI> moun|taines
<PB N="155" REF="91">
(for so they were
called) stand them in <HI>any</HI>

was taken with their cities,
and with their Citie of ci|ties,
<HI>Caralis,</HI> that the head|strong
nation, scarce worth
killing, might bee tamed
at last with the lacke of
their natiue soyle. The
two <HI>Scipio's, Cnaeus,</HI> and
<HI>Publius,</HI> sent into <HI>Spaine,</HI>
had pluckt away <HI>once</HI> all
hope from the <HI>Carthagini|ans,</HI>
but lost their hold a|gaine,
being destroyed by
the cunning inuentions of
the aduersarie. The <HI>Sci|pio's</HI>
had gotten indeede
great dayes, when they
gaue ouerthrowes; but the
one of them was circum|uented
<PB N="156" REF="92">
and slaine by their
dangerous deuices, as hee
was busie to entrench; and
the other <HI>of them,</HI> hauing
fled into a tower, was ouer|whelmed
fro~ round about

<HI>Scipio</HI> therefore, who dis|patcht
with an armie into

was the man to whom the

out of the conquest
of <HI>Africa,</HI> recouered all
<HI>Spaine,</HI> that braue martiall
countrey, ennobled for
cheualrie, and men of the

the enemies armies, that
schoole-mistresse of <HI>Anni|bal</HI>
himselfe; <HI>he conquered</HI>
<PB N="157" REF="92">
all of it, I say (though in|credible
to say it) from the
pillars of <HI>Hercules</HI> to the
Ocean, and I know not
whether more speedily, or
more easily: the speed,
foure yeeres speake; the
easinesse, one onely citie
manifesteth, being taken
vpon the same day in
which it was besieged; and
it was a fortunate signe of
<HI>Africa's</HI> conquest <HI>to ensue,</HI>
that <HI>Carthage</HI> in <HI>Spaine</HI>
was so easily taken. Cer|taine
it is notwithstanding,
that the admirable conti|nencie
of the Generall was
of greatest force to subdue
the prouince: for he resto|red
their yong sonnes, and
daughters, were they ne|uer
<PB N="158" REF="93">
so pleasing, or faire, <HI>back</HI>
to the barbarous, without
permitting them to come
in his sight, that hee might
not seeme to haue once sipt
or skimd the honour of
their chastitie so much, as
with beholding them. This
was <HI>then</HI> the carriage of
the <HI>Romans</HI> in diuers coun|treys
abroad, who yet, for
all that, could not be rid of
<HI>Annibal,</HI> who stuck close to
them in the bowels of <HI>Ita|lie;</HI>
for most nations had
reuolted vnto him, and
himselfe, a most smart and
excellent captaine, vsed
<HI>Italian</HI> forces against <HI>Italy.</HI>
We neuerthelesse had tri|ced
him out of most of her
townes and countries. <HI>Ta|rentus</HI>
<PB N="159" REF="93">
came in againe of it
selfe. <HI>Capua,</HI> the seat, dwel|ling
house, and the other
<HI>as it were, Carthage</HI> of <HI>An|nibal,</HI>
was now also gayned
backe, the losse whereof so
greatly grieued the man,
that thereupon hee turned
all his strengths vpon <HI>Rome.</HI>
O people, worthie to bee
lords of the earth, wor|thie
of all fauour, and to
haue the gouernment of
the affaires of men, and
gods! Driuen to the worst
of feares, yet gaue they not
ouer their enterprise, and
doubtfull how to keepe
their owne citie, they, for
all that, quitted not <HI>Capua,</HI>
but entrusting a part of
their armie to <HI>Appius</HI> Con|sull,
<PB N="160" REF="94">
and the residue fol|lowing
<HI>Flaccus</HI> into <HI>Rome,</HI>
they fought where they
were not, as well as where
they were. Why wonder
we therefore? For <HI>Annibal</HI>
encamping within three
miles of <HI>Rome,</HI> was resisted
by the Gods (nor will I
shame to confesse it) I say
by the Gods themselues,
because such store of raine
fell at euery remoue of his,
that he seemed put backe
by diuine prouision; not as
in defence of heauen, but
to keepe him off from the
citie-walls, and <HI>Capitol.</HI> Hee
therefore departed, &amp; fled,
and retired into the farthest
nooke of <HI>Italy,</HI> hauing done
all he could against <HI>Rome,</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="94">
sauing only giuen it assault.
It is but a trifle to speake of,
but yet of much efficacie,
to shew the magnanimitie
of the <HI>Romans,</HI> in that the
very field it selfe, where
<HI>Annibal</HI> encamped, being,
during the siege, set to sale,
found a chapman. On the
other side, <HI>Annibal,</HI> to imi|tate
their confidence, cryed
the goldsmiths row in the
citie, but no man would
buy of him. And thus we
may see there were presa|ges
enow. But so great
vertue of men, and so much
fauour of the Gods came to
nothing. For <HI>Asdrubal,</HI>
brother of <HI>Annibal,</HI> came
out of <HI>Spaine</HI> with a new
armie, new strengths, new
<PB N="162" REF="95">
weight of warre. <HI>Rome</HI> had
beene vndoubtedly quite
ruined, had that man ioy|ned
with his brother: but
<HI>Claudius Nero,</HI> and <HI>Liuius
Salinator,</HI> vtterly distrest
him as he was encamping,
<HI>Nero</HI> kept <HI>Annibal</HI> off in
the farthest corner of <HI>Italy.
Liuius</HI> marcht with ensigns
spred, into the quite oppo|site
quarter, that is, vp to
the very iawes of the first
descence from the <HI>Alpes</HI> in|to
<HI>Italie,</HI> the distance as
great, <HI>from our other camp,</HI>
as all the length of <HI>Italie.</HI>
It is not easie to say, with
what high wit, and speed,
the two Consuls vnited
their campes, and giuing
battell to <HI>Asdrubal,</HI> not
<PB N="163" REF="95">
aware <HI>of that vnion,</HI> de|stroid
him vtterly, <HI>Annibal</HI>

what was done. Sure
it is, that when the newes
came to <HI>Aniball,</HI> and hee
saw his brothers head tost
out before his trenches, I
acknowledge (quoth hee)
the vnluckines of <HI>Carthage.</HI>
This was the mans first
confession, not without a
sure presage of the fate
which hung ouer his head.
And now it was certaine
out of <HI>Anibals</HI> own mouth,
that <HI>Aniball</HI> might be van|quished.
But the people of
<HI>Rome,</HI> full of confidence, af|ter
so many fortunate suc|cesses,
held it a gallant at|tempt
to make an end of
<PB N="164" REF="96">
the quarrell, with the so|rest
enemie they had, <HI>and
that</HI> at his owne home, in
<HI>Africa.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. V. C. DXLIX.</NOTE> <HI>Scipio</HI> therefore

thither the whole
weight of warre, beginning
to imitate <HI>Aniball,</HI> and to
pay him <HI>backe</HI> in his <HI>Afri|ca,</HI>
for the mischiefes hee
did in their <HI>Italy.</HI> O yee
Gods! what forces of <HI>As|druball,</HI>
what armies of
king <HI>Syphax</HI> did hee ouer|throw?
what, and how
great were those two
camps, which hee in one
night consumed with fire?
To conclude, hee was not
now within three miles of
<HI>Carthage, as Aniball had
beene of Rome,</HI> but battred
<PB N="165" REF="96">
besieged gates themselues
therof: and thereby wrung
<HI>Aniball</HI> out of <HI>Italie,</HI> vp|on
which hee lay hard,
and heauie. Since <HI>Rome</HI>
stood, there was neuer a
grater day then that, in
which, two the most fa|mous
captaines that euer
were before, or since, the
one of them, conquerour
of <HI>Italy,</HI> the other of <HI>Spain,</HI>
confronted each the other
in battle-ray. But <HI>yet</HI> they
came <HI>first</HI> to a parley about
articles of peace: <HI>at which</HI>
both of them stood a good
while without speaking a
word, as if mutuall admi|ration
had fixt them to the
ground. But when they
could not agree vpon a
<PB N="166" REF="97">
peace, the trumpets sound
a charge. It is cleare, by
confession of both parties,
that no armies could bee
better marshall'd, nor any
battell be sorer fought, as
<HI>Scipio</HI> reported of <HI>Ani|bal's</HI>
armie, and <HI>Anibal</HI> of
<HI>Scipio's.</HI> But <HI>Aniball</HI> not|withstanding

themselues without seek|ing,
that the course of victo|rie

of which there went so ter|rible

and <HI>Darius,</HI> came then
to minde, in whose dayes
mountaines were cut tho|row,
and the sea was couerd

certaine prodigious signes
which seemed to threa|ten
somewhat from hea|uen,
bred terrour; for <HI>A|pollo</HI>

sweate. But this
<PB N="175" REF="101">
was nothing else saue
the God-heads agonie in

Asia.</HI> Nor, to say truth,
did any countrey so a|bound
with mony, riches,

but they were <HI>all</HI> in the
hands of so cowardly a
king, as could glorie in no|thing
more, then that hee
was ouercome by the <HI>Ro|mans.
Antiochus</HI> was thrust
into this warre, vpon the
one side by <HI>Thoas,</HI> chiefe of
the <HI>Aetolians,</HI> seeking <HI>in
vaine</HI> to draw the <HI>Romans</HI>

also, and impatient
of peace, sought ouer the
world where to finde out
an enemy of the <HI>Roman</HI>

of danger might that
haue proued, had that king
giuen himselfe ouer to his
directions? if <HI>Annibal,</HI> now
quite downe, had beene
trusted with the power of
<HI>Asia?</HI> But <HI>Antiochus,</HI>
relying vpon his owne a|bilities,
and the title of a
king, held it enough that
hee moued warre <HI>by him|selfe.
Europe</HI> did now
without controuersie be|long
to the <HI>Romans. An|tiochus</HI>
demanded backe
the citie of <HI>Lysimachia,</HI> vp|on
the coast of <HI>Thrace,</HI>
<PB N="177" REF="102">
built in <HI>Europe</HI> by his an|cestors,
as a parcell of his

it were starre, or constella|tion,
the tempest of the
<HI>Asian</HI> warre being stirred,
kings assembling in extra|ordinarie
number; and de|fiance
brauely giuen, when
<HI>Antiochus</HI> had thus wake|ned
all the humours of
<HI>Asia</HI> with wonderfull
noise, and tumult, hee be|tooke
himselfe to sports, &amp;
wanton pleasures, as if hee
had already gotten the
garland. The Iland <HI>Eu|baea</HI>
was diuided from the
maine land with <HI>Eurypus,</HI>
a narrow sea hauing many
ebbes, and flowes. here <HI>An|tiochus</HI>
pitching his paui|lions
<PB N="178" REF="103">
of silke, and gold,
hard vpon the brinke of
the murmuring sea, at the
sound of flutes, and other
musick, and though it were
winter, yet had hee roses
brought fresh from all
parts, and lest hee should
in nothing seeme to play
the captaine, he tooke mu|sters
of fine young boyes,
and girls. Such a king
therefore as this, whom his
owne riotous humours
had already conquer'd, the
people of <HI>Rome,</HI> assailing
that Iland, by <HI>Marcus
Atilius Glabrio,</HI> Consul, at
the very first bruit of ap|proach

<HI>Thermopylae</HI> (euer to bee
glorious in the death of
those three hundred <HI>La|cedaemonians)</HI>
yet not da|ting
to trust that strength
the <HI>Romans</HI> made him giue
way aswell at land, as sea.
Without delay he returns
into <HI>Asia. The charge of
his</HI> nauie roial hee com|mitted
to <HI>Polyxenes,</HI> and
<HI>Annibal.</HI> For <HI>himselfe</HI>
could not endure so much
as to looke vpon a fight.
So his whole force at sea
was torne in pieces by the

(for it was but foure yeeres

of the other two, the least
in labour. For the fight
was not so much with the
men, as with the citie it
selfe, the euen whereof
was certainely the greatest
that could bee: for it made
an end of <HI>Carthage.</HI> To

<PB N="201" REF="114">

contrary to the articles of

had once prepared an army
at land and sea, against the
<HI>Numidians,</HI> and often terri|fide
the borders of <HI>Masi|nassas</HI>

fauour to this good and
friendly king. When the
war was settled, the Senate
debated what should be|come
of <HI>Carthage. Cato,</HI>
whose hatred admitted no
satisfaction, would haue it
vtterly rased: but when the
Consull demanded ano|thers
opinion, <HI>Scipio Nasica</HI>
stood to haue it preserued,
<PB N="202" REF="115">
lest the feare of a riuall ci|tie
remoued, the felicitie of
<HI>Rome</HI> might growe <HI>ouer-ranke,</HI>
and riotous. The
<HI>Senate</HI> made choise of a

remoue the citie out of her

fired. Then calling
foorth the princes, they
commanded them, vppon

<PB N="203" REF="115">
the countrey. Which
blacke decree kindled so
great choler in them, as
they resolued to endure the
worst that could be, <HI>rather

<HI>hereupon</HI> did forthwith fill
the citie, and the crie went
round, To ARMES, the
finall resolution beeing,
whatsoeuer came of it, to
rebell. Not for that they
had now any hope left <HI>to
free themselues,</HI> but because
they held it better that
<HI>Carthage</HI> should bee ruind
by their owne hands, then
their enemies. The furie
of the rebels may be conie|ctured
by this, that they
pluckt downe house-tops,
and houses, <HI>with that tim|ber</HI>
<PB N="204" REF="116">
to build a new nauie;
for want of yron &amp; brasse,
their smiths wrought gold,
and siluer into armour; and
the matrons clipt the haire
of their heads to make cor|dage
for engins. <HI>Mancinus</HI>
Consull, the siege waxt hot
both at land, and sea. The
hauen of the fortifications,
and the first, and second
wal were dismantled, when
the castle notwithstanding,
called <HI>The Byrs,</HI> made <HI>such</HI>
a resistance as if it had been
another citie. Though
there was no doubt of o|uerthrowing
it, yet the <HI>Sci|pio's</HI>
seemd ordaind by de|stinie
for that purpose. The
people therefore of <HI>Rome</HI>
require to haue a <HI>Scipio</HI> for

accomplishing that warre.
And that was the sonne of
<HI>Paulus,</HI> conquerour of <HI>Ma|cedonia,</HI>
whom the sonne of
that great <HI>Scipio Africa|nus</HI>
had adopted, to vphold
the glory of his house, with
this intention of the fates,
that the citie which the
grandfather had humbled,
the grand child should sub|uert.
The enemies <HI>being</HI>
shut vp within the castle,
the <HI>Romans</HI> sought also to
cut off the sea. But the <HI>Car|thaginians</HI>
digge out a new
hauen vpon another side of
the towne, not to flie out
at, for no man did beleeue
they could escape, but from
the which a new armada
issued, as if it had growne

Meane-while no day, nor

For the fire which the ene|mies

but onely situated vpon a

more then foure thousand,
it endured fourteene yeers
siege against an armie of
fortie thousand: And not
endured onely, but gaue
also terrible ouerthrowes,
and forced vs to accept of
shamefull conditions. And
remayning vnconquer'd
after all was done that
could bee, no other person
would serue the turne to
subuert it, but he who sub|dued
<HI>Carthage.</HI> To speake
ingenuously, there was no
warre of ours, the cause
<PB N="223" REF="125">
whereof was more vniust
then was this. For the <HI>Se|gidensers,</HI>
their friends, and
kinsfolke, escaping our
hands, were entertained
by them. No intercession
vsed on their behalfe
would be heard. And al|beit
they abstained from
intermedling in any broils
of warre, they were not|withstanding
comman|ded,
if they would haue a
firme, and formall peace,
to purchase it by parting
with their armes. This
proposition was so inter|preted
by the barbarous,
as if they must goe hide a|way
their heads in holes.
Hereupon they forth with
fell to armes, <HI>Megaera</HI> a
<PB N="224" REF="126">
most braue souldier, their
captaine generall; and
charging <HI>Pompei</HI> home in
fight, they did choose to
enter league, when they
could haue made an end
of him. After this they set
vpon <HI>Mancinus,</HI> whom
they so amated with daily
slaughters, that he had not
a souldier in his army
durst looke a <HI>Numantine</HI> in
the face, or stand his voice,
yet <HI>such was their noble|nesse,</HI>
that they were con|tent
to make a peace with
him also, when they might
haue had the killing of all
his army to a man. But
the people of <HI>Rome</HI> no
lesse ashamed, nor stor|ming
lesse at the reproach
<PB N="225" REF="126">
of these conclusions of
peace with the <HI>Numan|tines,</HI>
then they did for
those at <HI>Caudium,</HI> dischar|ged
themselues from the
dishonour of that base
treatie, by yeelding vp
<HI>Mancinus</HI> to the enemie.
But Generall <HI>Scipio,</HI> one
throughly season'd for the
ouerthrow of cities by the
burning of <HI>Carthage,</HI> grew
hot at length vpon re|uenge.
But hee had more
worke within his owne
campe, then in the open
field; with his owne men,
then with the <HI>Numantians.</HI>
For his armie hauing <HI>vn|der
other captaines</HI> beene
formerly tired with dayly,
and iniust, but specially
<PB N="226" REF="127">
seruile labours, such of
them as knew not how to
vse their weapons, were
commaunded, <HI>for their
ease who knew the vse,</HI> to
carry more stakes, and
earth to the rampire, and
<HI>that</HI> those should be rayed
with durt, who would not
be smeared with bloud. Be|sides
that, strumpets, sculli|ons,
and all things else
which were not of neces|sitie
to be vsed, were cut a|way.
It is a saying, that
<HI>Such as the captaine is, such
is the souldier.</HI> The ar|mie,
thus reduced vnder
discipline, encounters the
enemie, and then came
that to passe which no
man did euer hope for; the
<PB N="227" REF="127">
<HI>Numantians,</HI> in sight of all
men, ranne away. They
would likewise haue yeel|ded
themselues, if the con|ditions
would haue beene
<HI>but</HI> tolerable for men to
accept. But nothing con|tenting
<HI>Scipio,</HI> sauing a
real, and absolute victorie,
they in such extremities
resolue to make a despe|rate
sallie, after they first
had feasted well, as at their
last viands, with halfe-raw
flesh, and a kinde of broth,
or drinke made of corne,
and called by the inhabi|tants
keale, or <HI>Caelia.</HI> This
resolution of theirs disco|uer'd
to <HI>Scipio,</HI> hee would
not afford, to men so min|ded,
the fauour of battell,
<PB N="228" REF="128">
but girts them vp close
with foure camps, and
hemming them round
within trench, and coun|terscarph,
they besought
him for fight, that so hee
might dispatch them like
men. But when that
would not bee granted,
they agree to rush out
howsoeuer, and comming
so to handy-strokes, very
many of them were slaine;
and famine now comming
fast vpon <HI>the residue,</HI> they
liued yet a little longer.
Their last helpe was to
flie, but their wiues brake
their horse-bridles, and
committing an heinous
offence through loue, be|reft
them of that remedy.
<PB N="229" REF="128">
Their end therefore be|ing
now no longer to bee
deferred, their sufferance
turnes into furie, decree|ing
among themselues to
die in this manner: They
made away their captains,
themselues, and towne
with the sword, with poy|son,
and with setting all on

The people therefore of

It is hard to say, whether

But the kingdome
of <HI>Numidia</HI> gaue to it selfe
a great blow, and though
<HI>Anibal</HI> was rid out of the
way, yet <HI>Iugurtha</HI> had that
in him which was to be fea|red:
for he, the most false &amp;
crafty prince vnder heauen,
ventured vpon the people
of <HI>Rome,</HI> glorious, for great
acts, and not to be conque|red
by the sword: and yet
things fell out beyond all
mens imaginations, that he
the king, who surpast all o|thers
in cunning, should
himselfe bee surprised by
cunning. This prince, gra~d-child
to <HI>Masinissa,</HI> and by a|doption
the son of <HI>Micipsa,</HI>
<PB N="241" REF="134">
moued to it by ambition of

to murther his bro|thers,
and yet not fearing
them so much as the Se|nate,
and people of <HI>Rome,</HI>
vnder whose protection,
and wardship they were,
wrought his first black feate

as hee was contriuing how

<HI>Iugurtha</HI> by soundly

<HI>to bribe others with,</HI> drew

<HI>Scaurus</HI> was appointed by

of the kingdome betweene
himselfe, and <HI>Adherbal,</HI> he
conquerd the noble quali|ties
of the Roman com|mon-weale
by corrupting
him, and effected thereby
his vndertaken wickednesse
the more boldly. But hai|nous
acts neuer lye hidden
long. The bribing of <HI>Scau|rus</HI>
came to light, and a de|cree
was made to reuenge
the parricidiall murther by
warre. <HI>Calpurnius Bestia,</HI>
Consull, was the first em|ploid
into <HI>Numidia.</HI> But
the king, experimentally
knowing, that gold could
doe more against the <HI>Ro|mans</HI>
then Iron, bought
his peace. Guilty of the
<PB N="243" REF="135">
premisses, hee notwithstan|ding
both came vpon sum|mons,
and safe-conduct to
<HI>Rome,</HI> and with like audaci|ousnesse
suborning the a|ctors,
murthered his com|petitor
in the kingdome,
<HI>Massina</HI> grand-child of <HI>Ma|sinissa.</HI>
This was another
cause for the <HI>Romans</HI> to take
armes vp against the tyrant.
The reuenge therefore was
committed to bee taken by
<HI>Albinus.</HI> But (&ocirc; the shame!)
<HI>Iugurtha</HI> so ouerbribed his
armie also, that our men
voluntarily giuing way, he
got the victory, and our
camp withall; and reckning
it in as a part of the price,
that hee suffered the armie
which he had bought, to
<PB N="244" REF="136">
escape his hands, did put
vpo~ vs dishonorable terms.
At the same time, <HI>Metellus</HI>
steppeth out against him,
not so much in reuenge of
the <HI>Roman</HI> empire, as to re|deeme
the blemishes there|of;
and dealing most cun|ningly,
one while by en|treaty,
another while by
threats, and fayning flight
when hee meant nothing
lesse, matcht him at his own
weapons: nor contenting
himselfe with the waste, &amp;
desolation of fields, and
villages, made attempts vp|on
the chiefe fortresses of
<HI>Numidia,</HI> and long time
sought to get <HI>Zama,</HI> though
in vaine: neuerthelesse hee
sackt <HI>Thala,</HI> where the kings
<PB N="245" REF="136">
munition, and treasures lay.
So hauing stript him out of
his cities, hee pursued him
through <HI>Mauritania,</HI> and
<HI>Getulia,</HI> flying his owne
confines, and kingdome.
Last of all, <HI>Marius,</HI> much
augmenting the armie, as
hauing, according to the
obscuritie of his birth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. V. C. DCXLII.</NOTE> ad|mitted
the scumme of <HI>Rome</HI>
to the oath of soldiers, sets
vpon <HI>Iugurtha</HI> wounded as
he was, &amp; already forced to
flie, and yet ouer-came him
no more easily then as if he
had beene fresh, and vnbro|ken.
This man most fortu|nately
mastred <HI>Capsa,</HI> a citie
dedicated to <HI>Hercules,</HI> sea|ted
in the middle of <HI>Africa,</HI>
enuironed with sands, and
<PB N="246" REF="137">
serpents, and scaled <HI>Mulu|cha,</HI>
built vpon a steepe
mountaine, a certaine <HI>Ligu|rian</HI>
leading vp to it vpon
break-necke clifs, and high
ouer-hanging places; and
gaue to <HI>king Bocchus,</HI> who
for kindreds sake tooke his

<HI>Cirta. Bocchus</HI> thereupon
distrusting his owne estate,
and fearing to be drawn in|to
another mans ruine, as
accessarie, indented for his
owne peace, and safetie at
the perill of <HI>Iugurtha.</HI> So
that most false and slipperie
man, by his father in Lawes
practices ensnared, was be|traid
into the hands of <HI>Sul|la.</HI>
Thus in the end the
people of <HI>Rome</HI> had the ga|zing

with yrons in triumph:
and he againe though ouer|borne,

would one day perish, if it
could once meete with a

not daring presently
to encounter them, held
<PB N="253" REF="140">
his souldiers within their
strength, till that inuinci|ble
rage, and furious on|set,
which goes current
with the barbarous for
true valour, fell. Thereup|on,
they marcht about
back, craking, and vpbray|ding
vs, and asking in scorn
(so confident they were of
sacking the citie) what
they would haue home to
their wiues. Nor more
slowly then was menaced,
they rusht thorow the
<HI>Alps,</HI> that is to say, the ve|ry
barres of <HI>Italy,</HI> in three
maine battels. <HI>Marius</HI>
makes wondrous speed <HI>af|ter,</HI>
and out-stripping the

ouertakes the <HI>Theutons,</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="141">
who had the vantguard,
at the very climbe of the
<HI>Alps,</HI> in a place called <HI>A|quae
Sextiae,</HI> and quite di|strest
them in their ouer|much
security. The e|nemy
was master of the
valley, and riuer, and our
men had no water <HI>to
drinke</HI> at all. Whether
<HI>Marius</HI> tooke that <HI>drie</HI>
ground of purpose, or
turn'd by wit his errour to
aduantage, is doubtfull to
say, but courage inforced
by necessity, was for cer|taine,
the cause of victorie.
For his army crying out
for water, <HI>Yee are men</HI>
(quoth hee) <HI>and there it is:</HI>
they fought therfore with
such courage, &amp; made such
<PB N="255" REF="141">
slaughter of the <HI>enemies,</HI>
that the <HI>Romans</HI> hauing
the day, dranke not more
water out of the colour'd
riuer, then they did of the
bloud of the barbarous.
Surely, king <HI>Theutobocchus</HI>
himselfe, who was wont to
vawt ouer foure, or fiue
horses let together, had
scarce any time to get one
now for himselfe to flie
away vpon, and, be|ing
apprehended in the
next forest, was single an
whole shew himselfe,
being a person of so huge
an height, as hee ouer|topt
the tropheas selues.
The <HI>Theutons</HI> vtterly
<HI>thus</HI> destroide, hee turnes
vpon the <HI>Cimbrians.</HI>
<PB N="256" REF="142">
(who would beleeue it?)
clambring ouer at the crags
of <HI>Tridentum,</HI> through the
snow, which makes it win|ter
all wayes on the <HI>Alps,</HI>
and raiseth them higher
then naturally their ridges
are, came rolling down vp|on
<HI>Italy</HI> in plumps. They
attempted to passe the ri|uer
<HI>Athesis,</HI> not by bridge,
or boat, but according to
their lubberly wits, assaid
to stop it first with their bo|dies:
but when they saw
they could not stay the
streame with their hands,
and targets, they plasht
downe trees, and so crost
ouer: and had they imme|diately
set on towards the
citie, the perill had beene
<PB N="257" REF="142">
extremely great. But in the
<HI>Venetian</HI> grounds, whose
mould is in a manner the
finest of all <HI>Italie,</HI> the dain|tinesse
of the ayre, and soile
entendred their spirits; and
being otherwise well soft|ned
with the vse of bread,
sodden flesh, and sweete
wines, <HI>Marius</HI> in very good
season sets vpon them: they
praid him to assigne them
a day of battell, which hee
named to be the next of all.
They ioyned in a most
spacious champaine called
<HI>Caudium,</HI> and there one
hundred, and fortie thou|sand
of them left their
liues: so they were fewer
now <HI>in the whole first num|ber,</HI>
by another third. They
<PB N="258" REF="143">
had the execution of the
barbarous for an whole
dayes space. These also
taught our captaine gene|rall
to piece out manhood
with martiall cunning, imi|tating
<HI>Anibal,</HI> and his artes
at <HI>Cannae:</HI> for hauing to be|ginne
with, a mistie day, &amp;
by that <HI>an</HI> aduantage to
charge them at vnaware, &amp;
the same a windie one also,
which might serue to carry
the dust into their eyes, and
faces, <HI>Marius, making vse
of all,</HI> ranged his battell
towards the rising Sunne,
so that the brightnesse, and
repercussion of the beames
vpon <HI>our</HI> helmets, made
the heauens seem as if they
were on fire, as was by and
<PB N="259" REF="143">
by, afterwards vnderstood
by the captiues, nor was it
a lesse worke to ouercome
their wiues, then them|selues.
For hauing made
a <HI>barricado</HI> about them
with carts, and waggons,
they strooke at vs from
aloft, as it were from towr|toppes,
with slaues, and
lances. Their death was
as gallant as their fight.
For when the ambassage
which they dispatched to
<HI>Marius,</HI> could not obtaine
liberty <HI>at his hands,</HI> and
priesthood (nor was it law|full)
they euery-where
strangled their infants, or
pasht out their braines, and
either, one of them kill'd
the other, or making
<PB N="260" REF="144">
halters of their tresses
of haire trust themselues
vp by the necks, vpon
boughs, or the rails of their
carts. King <HI>Beleus</HI> fighting
couragiously was beaten
downe dead, and not a|gainst
his will. The <HI>other</HI>
battell <HI>consisting</HI> of the <HI>Ti|gurins,</HI>
which had taken
vp the smaller hils of the
<HI>Norick Alps,</HI> as it were for
a back, or succour to their
fellowes, betaking them|selues
to base flight, and
trading in robberies, slipt
away whither they could,
and vanished. These so
glad, and glorious newes,
concerning the libertie of
<HI>Italy,</HI> and the deliuerance
of the empire, came <HI>first</HI> to
<PB N="261" REF="144">
the peoples eares not by
men, as the manner is, but
(if it be not against religion
to beleeue it) by the Gods
themselues. For the same
day, vpon which the thing
was done, young men
crown'd with laurel, were
seene before the temple of
<HI>Castor,</HI> and <HI>Pollux,</HI> reach|ing
letters to the Praetor,
and a common rumour
without a knowne author,
luckily ran in the theater,
The <HI>Cimbrians</HI> are ouer|come.
Then which thing
what could be more admi|rable,
or glorious? for <HI>Rome,</HI>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The war with Mithridates.</HEAD>
<P>_THe <HI>Pontick</HI> nati|ons
are plan|ted
towards the
North vpon the sea on the
left hand of vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. V. C. DCLIX.</NOTE> and are so
called of the <HI>Pontick</HI> sea.
The first king of all these
nations, and countreys
was <HI>Atheas,</HI> afterwards
<HI>Artabazes,</HI> who descended
of the seuen <HI>Persians.
Mithridates</HI> comming of
him, was the mightiest of
<HI>them</HI> all. For whereas foure
yeeres serued against <HI>Pyr|rhus,</HI>
&amp; seuenteene yeeres
against <HI>Anibal,</HI> he resisted
fortie yeeres, till finally
<PB N="267" REF="147">
subdued in three huge
warres, the felicity of <HI>Sulla,</HI>
the vertue of <HI>Lucullus,</HI> and
the mightinesse of <HI>Pompei,</HI>
brought him to nothing.
Hee pretended <HI>for</HI> the
cause of his hostility, be|fore
lieutenant <HI>Cassius,
Nicomedes</HI> of <HI>Bithynia,</HI>
whom hee charged with
inuading his confines.
But the truth is, that
blowne-out with ambiti|on,
hee coueted the mo|narchie
of all <HI>Asia,</HI> and, if
hee could, of <HI>Europe</HI> al|so.
Our vices gaue him
hope, and confidence
vnto it. For being diui|ded
among our selues
with ciuill warres, the <HI>ve|rie</HI>
opportunitie allured
<PB N="268" REF="148">
him and <HI>Marius, Sulla,</HI> and
<HI>Sertorius</HI> laid that remote
side of the empire open.
In these wounds of the
commonweale, and amidst
these tumults, this sudden
whirlewinde of the <HI>Pontick</HI>
warre, as if taking aduan|tage
of the times, blew
from off as it were the far|most
watch-towre of the
Northerne world at vna|wares
vpon vs, being both
wearie then, and diuerse|ly
distracted. The first
blast of this warre swept
away <HI>Bithynia from vs</HI> in
a trice. Then the like
terrour fell vpon <HI>the rest
of Asia.</HI> Nor were the
cities, and nations there|of
slow in reuolting to
<PB N="269" REF="148">
the king. And hee was at
hand, and prest <HI>them</HI> hard,
vsing crueltie as a vertue.
For what was more dead|ly
dire, then that one edict
of his, by which hee com|maunded
all men thorow
<HI>Asia,</HI> who were free of
<HI>Rome,</HI> to be massacred? At
that time certainely, hou|ses,
temples, altars, and all
<HI>sorts of</HI> lawes, <HI>aswell</HI> di|uine,
as humane, were vi|olated.
But this terrour
vpon <HI>Asia,</HI> vnlockt <HI>Eu|rope</HI>
also to the king.
By <HI>Archelaus</HI> therefore,
and <HI>Neoptolemus,</HI> hee
disseised vs <HI>there</HI> of all,
excepting <HI>Rhodes onely</HI>
(which held for vs more
firmely then the rest) of
<PB N="270" REF="149">
<HI>the Iles of</HI> the <HI>Cyclades,
Delos,</HI> and <HI>Eubaea,</HI> yea
and <HI>Athens</HI> also, the
glorie it selfe of <HI>Greece.</HI>
The terrour of the kings
<HI>name</HI> breathed now vp|on
<HI>Italy it selfe,</HI> and
vpon the verie citie of
<HI>Rome. Lucius Sulla</HI> there|fore,
an excellent good
man, while hee was in ac|tion
of armes, and of no
lesse violence, shoued
the enemie backe as it
were with one of his
hands, from encroaching
anie farther. And first
hee brought <HI>Athens</HI> to
such extremities <HI>by siege,</HI>
that hee made that citie
(what man would cre|dit
it?) which was the
<PB N="271" REF="149">
mother of corne, to eate
mans flesh for hunger, and
vndermining their port <HI>Pi|raeus,</HI>
and more then sixe
walls of theirs, after he had
tamed them, yet, though
himselfe called them the
most ingratefull men, hee
neuerthelesse restored to
them their temples, and re|putation,
for the honor, <HI>and
reuerence</HI> of deceased an|cestors:
and when <HI>Eubaea,</HI> &amp;
<HI>Baeotia</HI> had now chased the
garrisons away which the
King had billetted vpon
them, hee discomfited all
the royall forces together,
in one <HI>set</HI> battell at <HI>Chero|naea,</HI>
and in another at <HI>Or|chomenus:</HI>
and <HI>from thence</HI>
crossing forthwith into <HI>A|sia,</HI>
<PB N="272" REF="150">
distrest <HI>Mithridates</HI> him|selfe:
and there also had
beene an end of the quarell,
if his desire had not rather
bin to haue triumpht spee|dily
ouer the enemie then
co~pletely: this was the state
in which <HI>Sulla</HI> left <HI>Asia.</HI> The
league with the <HI>Pontickes</HI>
recouerd <HI>Bithynia</HI> of <HI>Nico|medes,</HI>
and <HI>Cappadocia</HI> of
<HI>Ariobarzanes;</HI> as if <HI>Asia</HI>
had againe beene ours, as at
the beginning: but <HI>Mithri|dates</HI>
was but repulsed on|ly.
This course therefore
daunted not the <HI>Ponticks,</HI>
but set them more on fire.
For the king hauing had <HI>A|sia,</HI>
and as it were tasted the
bait of <HI>Europe,</HI> sought to
recouer it now by the law
<PB N="273" REF="150">
of armes, not as belonging
to others, but, because hee
had once lost it, as his own.
These fires therefore, as
not sufficiently quencht,
brake out into a greater
flame then before; where|vpon
<HI>the king</HI> repairing his
armies, augmented with
greater numbers the~ earst;
and to bee briefe, with the
whole powers of his realm,
he inuaded <HI>Asia</HI> againe by
sea, and land, and riuers.
<HI>Cyzicum</HI> a citie ennobled
with a castle, walls, port, &amp;
towers of marble, beauti|fies
the shores of <HI>Asia.</HI> A|gainst
this place, as if it
were another <HI>Rome,</HI> hee
bent his vtmost abilities:
but the citie was encoura|ged
<PB N="274" REF="151">
to withstand vpon the
newes of <HI>Lucullus</HI> his ap|proach,
who (a wondrrous
thing to bee spoken) flo|ting
on a blowne bladder,
and steering himself with
his feete, seeming, to such
as lookt-on a farre off, like
some swimming whale, es|caped
thorow the middle
of the enemies fleete: and
calamitie foorthwith tur|ning
it-selfe to the other
side, the king tyred with
protraction of the siege, &amp;
famine bringing plague,
<HI>Lucullus</HI> ouertooke him in
his retreat, and made such
worke among his men, that
the riuers <HI>Granicus</HI> and <HI>Ae|sopus</HI>
ranne bloud; the craf|tie
king knowing the <HI>Ro|mans</HI>
<PB N="275" REF="151">
couetousnesse, will'd
his people to scatter fardles
and money as they fled, to
slacken the pursuers speed:
neither was his flight more
fortunate by sea, then it
was by land; for his nauie
which consisted of one
hundred saile, deepe laden
with munition, ouertaken
with a tempest in the sea of
<HI>Pontus,</HI> suffered such foule
spoile, as answered the mis|chiefe
of a battel at sea: no
otherwise then as if <HI>Lucul|lus,</HI>
beeing as it were in
league with the winds, and
waues, might seeme to
haue giuen order to the
weather, for beating down
<HI>Mithridates.</HI> Though all
the strengths of that most
<PB N="276" REF="152">
powerfull kingdome were
in this wise ground to pie|ces,
yet losses made his spi|rit
greater. Betaking him|selfe
therefore to his next
neighbor nations, he drew
the whole <HI>East</HI> almost, and
<HI>North</HI> of the world to ac|companie
his ruine. <HI>Iberi|ans,
Caspians, Albans,</HI> and
eitherr of the <HI>Armenia's</HI>
were solicited to take part,
&amp; <HI>Pompet's</HI> fortune sought
euery where about for dig|nitie,
name, and titles with
which to glorifie him, who
beholding <HI>Asia</HI> on fire
with new combustions, and
that more kings sprung still
out of other, iudging it no
wisedome to delay time,
while in the meane space
<PB N="277" REF="152">
the powers of <HI>enemy</HI>-coun|treys
might vnite them|selues,
he forthwith makes
a bridge of boates, and, of
all men before his dayes,
was the first of ours who
passed ouer <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and
lighting vpon the flying
king in the middle of <HI>Ar|menia,</HI>
made a dispatch of
the warre (how great was
the happines of the man!)
in one onely battel: this
was fought by night, and
the moone was also for vs:
for shining at the backe of
the enemie, as if shee were
in pay on our side, and in
the faces of the <HI>Romans,</HI> the
<HI>Pontickes</HI> mistaking their
owne shadowes, proiected
long, as at her going down,
<PB N="278" REF="153">
laid at them as at the <HI>ve|rie</HI>
bodies of their enemies.
So <HI>Mithridates</HI> was that
night vtterly vanquished.
For from that time for|ward
hee was able to doe
nothing, though trying all
the wayes possible, after
the maner of snakes, whose
head being bruised, they
threaten last of all with
the taile. For after his e|scape,
his meaning was to
terrifie <HI>Colchos,</HI> the sea-coasts
of <HI>Cilicia,</HI> and our
<HI>Campania,</HI> with his sudden
comming: then, ouertur|ning
the port <HI>Pyraeus,</HI> to
ioyne the countreyes toge|ther
as farre as betweene
<HI>Colchis,</HI> and <HI>Bosphorus,</HI> from
thence to march through
<PB N="279" REF="153">
<HI>Thracia, Macedonia,</HI> and
<HI>Greece,</HI> and so to assaile <HI>Ita|ly</HI>
vpon the sudden. These
were his projects, and they
went no farther. For his
subiects reuolting from
him, and himselfe preuen|ted
by the treason of his
sonne <HI>Pharnaces,</HI> hauing
labourd in vaine to effect it
by poison, he kild himselfe
with his sword. Meane|while
<HI>Cnaeus</HI> the Grreat,
pursuing the remainders of
the rebellion of <HI>Asia,</HI> flew
vp, and downe <HI>at pleasure</HI>
through diuers countreys,
and nations. For following
the <HI>Armenians</HI> towards
the east, and taking <HI>Artax|ata</HI>
their principall citie, he
granted back the kingdom
<PB N="280" REF="154">
to <HI>Tigranes,</HI> vpon <HI>his</HI> sub|mission.
But in marching
north, towards <HI>Scythia,</HI> he
guided his course by starrs&punc;
as if he had bin at sea; puts
the <HI>Colchians</HI> to the sword;
takes the <HI>Iberians</HI> to mer|cie,
spares the <HI>Albanes,</HI> and
encamping vnder mount
<HI>Caucasus</HI> ir-selfe, comman|ded
<HI>Orodes,</HI> the <HI>Cholchian</HI>
king, to descend from
thence into the plaine; <HI>Ar|toces,</HI>
prince of the <HI>Iberians</HI>
to giue in his children for
hostages: of his own meere
motion he rewards <HI>Orodes,</HI>
sending vnto him out of
his <HI>Albania,</HI> a couch of
gold, and other gifts; then
turning his forces South|ward,
&amp; marching through
<PB N="281" REF="154">
<HI>Libanus</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> and <HI>Da|mascus,</HI>
he displaid the <HI>Ro|man</HI>
ensignes round about,
passing through those odo|riferous
woods, and groues
of balme and frankincense.
The <HI>Arabians</HI> were at his
seruice. The <HI>Iewes</HI> assaid to
defend <HI>Hierusalem:</HI> But he
forced that citie also, and
saw openly that grand my|sterie,
as vnder a skie of
<HI>beaten</HI> gold; the brethren
at ods about the kingdom,
<HI>and</HI> hee made vmpire, ad|iudged
the crowne to <HI>Hir|canus;</HI>

into yrons for refusing to
obey the award. Thus the

land-life, they lanch a|gaine
into their water, and
somewhat farther out then
formerly. So <HI>Pompey,</HI> for|tunate
before that time,
seemed now also worthy
to haue the glory of this
seruice, as an accession to
his imployments against
<HI>Mithridates.</HI> This pestilent
plague dispiersed ouer the
whole sea, he resoluing to
extinguish at once, and for
euer, carryed his attempt
<PB N="286" REF="157">
with a kinde of diuine pre|paration.
For hauing a|bundance
of ships aswell
of the <HI>Romans,</HI> as of our
friends, the <HI>Rhodians,</HI> hee
guarded both the sides
of <HI>Pontus,</HI> and the coasts
of the <HI>Ocean,</HI> with many
vice-admirals, &amp; comman|ders.
<HI>Gellius</HI> was set to waft
vpon the <HI>Tuscan</HI> sea; <HI>Plo|tius</HI>
vpon the <HI>Sicilian; Gra|tillius</HI>
vpon the <HI>Ligustine</HI>

vpon the very iawes of <HI>Pro|pontis;</HI>
who so shrowded
his fleete, that hee watcht
at that passage, as if it had
beene at a gate. So all the
pyrates wheresoeuer, thus
enuironed, within as it were
an hunting toyle, at all
harbours, bayes, shelters,
creekes, promontories,
straights, halfe-iles, were
vtterly distressed. <HI>Pom|pey</HI>
vndertooke <HI>Cilicia,</HI>
the mother, and fountaine
of this warre. And the e|nemies
were forward to
fight, not for any hope
they had, but because that
being ouerborne, they
would seeme to dare: but
yet no farther, then as only
<PB N="288" REF="158">
to brooke the first shocke.
For when they beheld the
beake-heads of our clash|ing
gallies charge in ring
vpon them, they forthwith
strooke saile, threw away
oares, made a generall
showt (a signe among them
of yeelding) and begged
life. A victory gaind with
lesse bloudshed then this,
as we at no time had, so nei|ther
did wee euer finde a
people more loyall to vs
then they. And that was
long of our Generals high
wisedome, who transplan|ted
this broode of mariners
far of, out of the very ken
of the sea, and as it were
teddred them fast in the vp|lands.
Thus at the same
<PB N="289" REF="158">
time he recouerd the seas,
for the vse of merchants, &amp;
restored to land her owne
men. In this victory what
should we first admire? whe|ther
celerity, because it was

good fortune, for that hee
lost not a vessell? or finally

vpon <HI>Caesar</HI> the con|quest
of that which was
left vntoucht in <HI>Europe.</HI>
And there remained the
most terrible of all other
nations, the <HI>Galls,</HI> and <HI>Ger|mans:</HI>
and <HI>Britaine</HI> though
diuided from the whole
world, yet had notwith|standing
one to con|quer
it. The first cause of
this trouble begun at the
<HI>Heluetians,</HI> who seated
betweene the <HI>Rhene,</HI> and
<HI>Rhodanus,</HI> and their coun|treys
<PB N="298" REF="163">
<HI>prouing</HI> to narrow
for their swarmes, came to
demand <HI>of vs</HI> other habi|tations,
hauing first set
their townes on fire. A
solemne signe among them
of neuer returning thither.
But <HI>we</HI> asking time for de|liberation,
and during that
delay, when <HI>Caesar,</HI> by cut|ting
downe the bridge o|uer
<HI>Rhone,</HI> had taken from
them the meanes of flying
away, hee by and by led
backe that most warlike
people into their olde
homes, as a shepheard
driues his flocks to their
sheep-folds. The follow|ing
battell which was
fought against the <HI>Belgia~s,</HI>
was much more bloudy, as
<PB N="299" REF="163">
against men who fought
for freedome. Here the <HI>Ro|mans</HI>
did many famous
feats of armes, and this of
<HI>Caesar's</HI> was most singular,
that his army inclining to
flie, hee snatcht the target
from one who was run|ning
away, and charging
vpon the face of the ene|mies,
restored the battell
with his <HI>owne</HI> hand. After
this hee encountred the
<HI>Veneti</HI> at sea, but the com|bat
was greater with the
<HI>Ocean</HI> then with the ene|mies
shippes. For they
were bungerly made, and
mis-shapen, and had pre|sently
beene split with
our beake-heads, but the
shallow places hindred
<PB N="300" REF="164">
the fight, that the tide
withdrawing vpon course,
during the skirmish, the
<HI>Ocean</HI> might as it were
seeme to haue beene stick|ler
in the battell. He had
<HI>elsewhere</HI> also to deale with
difficulties which grew
from the nature of the na|tions,
and places. The
<HI>Aquitans,</HI> a subtill genera|tion,
betooke themselues
to grots, and holes vnder
ground: <HI>Caesar</HI> had damd
them vp. The <HI>Morini</HI>
slipt aside into the woods:
hee commanded to fire
them. Let no man say the
<HI>Galls</HI> are onely fierce, they
vse fraud also. <HI>Induciomarus</HI>
assembled the <HI>Treuirists,
Ambiorix</HI> the <HI>Eburones,</HI>
<PB N="301" REF="164">
and making a combinati|on
<HI>among themselues</HI> in
<HI>Caesars</HI> absence, both of
them found out his <HI>seueral</HI>
lieutenants generall. But
<HI>Titus Labienus</HI> stoutly re|pulsed
the one of them, &amp;
brought that kings head
away. The other laying
an <HI>ambuscado</HI> in the vally,
ouercame <HI>vs</HI> by craft, and
so the campe was sackt,
and the gold <HI>thereof</HI> taken.
There wee lost <HI>Cotta,</HI> with
<HI>Titurius Sabinus</HI> lieutena~t
generall. Nor could wee
euer bee-meet with that
king after, for hee plaide
least in sight beyond the
<HI>Rhene</HI> perpetually. But
<HI>Rhene,</HI> for all that, escaped
vs not, as neither was it fit,
<PB N="302" REF="165">
that it should be a free re|ceiuer,
and defender of
<HI>our</HI> enemies. But <HI>Caesar's</HI>
ground of warre against
the <HI>Germans</HI> was at first
most iust. For the <HI>Sequani</HI>
complain'd of their incur|sions.
How great was <HI>then</HI>
the pride of <HI>Ariouistus?</HI>
when <HI>our</HI> ambassadours
said, <HI>Come thou to</HI> Caesar?
<HI>What is that</HI> Caesar? quoth
the king? <HI>And let him come</HI>
to mee <HI>if hee will, and what
concernes it him what our</HI>
Germanie <HI>doth? am I a
meddler in the</HI> Roman <HI>af|faires?</HI>
The terrour ther|fore
of this new nation
was so great throughout
the campe, that they who
were of the maine battell,
<PB N="303" REF="165">
made euery-where their
last wills, and testaments.
But those giant like bodies,
by how much the huger
they were, by so much
were they the fairer marke
for a sword, or dart to hit.
What the feruour of our
souldiers was in the fight,
cannot bee set forth in any
example more clearely
then in this, that when the
barbarous whelm'd their
shields ouer their heads,
couering themselues as vn|der
a roofe, or pent-house,
or as a tortoys vnder the
shell, the <HI>Romans</HI> sprung vp
vpon the shields, and
from thence did cut their
throats. Againe, when the
<HI>Menapians</HI> complaind <HI>to
<PB N="304" REF="166">
vs</HI> of the <HI>Germans, Caesar</HI>
passeth ouer the <HI>Mose,</HI> vp|on
a bridge of boats, seekes
out <HI>Rhene</HI> it selfe, and the
enemies, among the <HI>Herci|nian</HI>
woods. But all the
whole race of them was
fled into the wildes, and
marshes, the army of the
<HI>Romans</HI> appearing on a
sudden on this side the
banke of <HI>Rhene,</HI> strooke
such an amazement among
them. Nor did we crosse
that riuer onely once, but
againe also, and that by a
bridge made ouer it. At
which time their affright
was much augmented,
when they beheld their
<HI>Rhene</HI> taken prisoner as it
were, and yoaked with a
<PB N="305" REF="166">
bridge, betaking them|selues
afresh in flight to
their forests, and fennie
places; that which most
fretted <HI>Caesar,</HI> being that
hee had not whom to con|quer.
Thus all made ours
both at land, and sea, hee
casts his eye vpon the <HI>Oce|an,</HI>
and as if the <HI>Roman</HI>
world sufficed not, his
minde was set how to at|chieue
another. For this
cause gathering a nauie, he
made for <HI>Britaine.</HI> Hee
crost into <HI>Britaine</HI> with
marueilous speed; for
weighing anchor out of
the harbour of the <HI>Morini,</HI>
at the third watch, hee
was landed in the Iland
before noone. The shores
<PB N="306" REF="167">
there, were full of the ene|mies
troubled troups, and
the chariots of war whirled
vp and downe <HI>disorderly,</HI>
their riders quaking at the
wonder of the sight: their
feare therefore was instead
of a victorie. The timorous
<HI>Britans</HI> yeelded vp their
armes, and gaue hostages:
and <HI>Caesar</HI> had <HI>then</HI> marcht
farther, had not the <HI>Ocean</HI>
giuen his shatterd fleete a
sore scourging with his bil|lowes.
Thereupon he re|turnd
into <HI>Gall,</HI> and with a
greater armada, and more
forces <HI>then before,</HI> did
thrust out once againe into
the same <HI>Ocean,</HI> and againe
pursuing the same <HI>Britans</HI>
into the <HI>Caledonian</HI> woods,
<PB N="307" REF="167">
he also caused <HI>Cauelianus,</HI>
one of their kings, to bee
fast bound in chaines. Con|tenting
himselfe with this
(for his intention was not
to get prouinces, but glo|rie)
he makes back into <HI>Gall</HI>
with more spoiles then at
first, the <HI>Oceans</HI> selfe more
quiet, and fauourable, as if
it confest it selfe too weake
for <HI>Caesar.</HI> But the last
mightiest conspiracie of
the <HI>Galls,</HI> was, when that
prince so dreadfull for sta|ture,
martiall skill, and
courage, and whose very
name seem'd deuised to
strike a terrour, <HI>Vercinge|torix,</HI>
drew at once all the
<HI>Aruernois,</HI> and <HI>Bituriges</HI>
the <HI>Carnutes,</HI> and <HI>Sequani</HI>
<PB N="308" REF="168">
into a league, by speaking
bigge among them, when
the assemblies of people
were thickest, <HI>as</HI> in their
groues vpon festiuall, and
counsel-dayes, erecting
their mindes <HI>thereby</HI> for
recouerie at their antient
libertie. <HI>Caesar</HI> was at this
time absent <HI>out of Gallia,</HI>
busie in taking fresh mu|sters
of <HI>Rauenna,</HI> and the
<HI>Alps themselues</HI> heapt
high with winter snowes,
and so the wayes cloyed
vppe, they presumed hee
was fast, and safe enough.
But of how fortunate a
rashnesse was hee at the
newes? Ouer cragges, and
cliffes of mountaines,
thorow wayes, and drifts
<PB N="309" REF="168">
of snow, till that time
pathlesse, hee with light|armed
bands of souldiers
got into <HI>Gall,</HI> vnited his
winter-camps there, which
stood farre distant, and was
himselfe in person in the
middle of <HI>Gallia,</HI> before
the remotest part feared
his comming. Then as|saulting
the heart-strengths
of the warre, hee destroy'd
<HI>Auaricum,</HI> and a garri|son
in it of fortie thousand,
and leuel'd <HI>Alexia</HI> to the
ground with fire, which
had two hundred, and
fiftie thousand fighting
men to rescue it. The
whole stresse of the warre
was about <HI>Gergouia.</HI> For
that most spacious citie,
<PB N="310" REF="169">
hauing foure score thou|sand
defendents, walls al|so,
a castell, and craggie
cliffes, was girt-in round
by <HI>Caesar</HI> with workes,
stakes, and a ditch through
which hee drew the ri|uer,
and with eighteene
seuerall camps in the
whole compasse, and an
huge counterscarpe, by
which meanes he tamed it
first with famine, and such
of the defendents as durst
sally out, being either
cut in pieces in the tren|ches
with the sword, or
gored vpon the stakes, hee
at last constrained it to
yeeld. That very king
himselfe, the principall

both came like an humble

their aduenturous

holy, pious, &amp; (as we haue

while the simplenesse, and
puritie of that shepheardish

the immiuent feare of the
<HI>Paenish</HI>-men maintain'd a|mong

The other hundred
yeeres (which wee reckon

<PB N="319" REF="173">
to haue rested content with
<HI>Sicilia,</HI> and <HI>Africk,</HI> yea, or
to haue wanted them also,
hauing <HI>Italie</HI> at command,
then to growe to such
greatnesse as to bee consu|med
with their proper
strengths. For what other
things else bred ciuill fu|ries,
but the too much
ranknesse of prosperitie?
The first thing which cor|rupted
vs, was the conquest
of <HI>Syria,</HI> &amp; next after that,
the heritage of the king of
<HI>Pergamus</HI> in <HI>Asia.</HI> The
wealth, and riches <HI>of those
countries</HI> were the things
which crusht vnder them
the morall vertues of that
age, and ouerthrew the
co~monweal drownd in her
<PB N="320" REF="174">
owne vices as in a common
sinke. For what cause was
there why the people of
<HI>Rome</HI> should stand so hard
for fields, or foode, but as
they were driuen by the
hunger which prodigalitie
had procured? From hence
therefore sprang the first,
and second <HI>Gracchan</HI> sedi|tions,
&amp; that third <HI>Appulei|an.</HI>
And out of what other
ground did it growe, that
the knights, and gentlemen
<HI>of Rome</HI> separated them|selues
from the Lords, to
haue soueraigne power in
seates of iudgement, but
<HI>meerely</HI> out of couetousnes,
that so they might conuert
to priuate lucre the custo|mary
paiments due to the
<PB N="321" REF="174">
State, and euen iudgements
in law it self? This brought
in the promise of making
all <HI>Latium</HI> free of <HI>Rome.</HI>
from whence rose the war
with associats. And what
bred the warre with bond|men?
what? but the great
nu~ber of them in families?
whence came the armies
of fensers against their ow|ners,
but for the excessiue
prodigality <HI>vsed in showes</HI>
for gaining popular fauour?
While the <HI>Romans</HI> giue
themselues ouer to showes
of sword-players, they
brought that to bee a pro|fession,
and Arte, which
was before <HI>those times</HI> the
punishment of enemies.
And, to touch our more
<PB N="322" REF="175">
gallant vices, was it not o|uer-much
wealth which
stirr'd <HI>among vs</HI> riualities
in honours? Or did not the
stormes of <HI>Marius,</HI> and
<HI>Sylla,</HI> and the magnificent
furniture of feasts, &amp; sump|tuous
presents, rise out of
that abundance, which are
long would bring forth
beggerie? This was it
which made <HI>Catiline</HI> fall
foule vpon his countrey.
To bee briefe, what other
fountaine had that very
desire <HI>in some</HI> of soueraign|ty,
&amp; to rule alone, but too
much store of wealth? But
that desire did mutually
arme <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Pompey</HI>
with those mortall enmi|ties,
which like the furies
<PB N="323" REF="175">
firebrands set <HI>Rome</HI> on a
bright blaze. Our purpose
therefore is, to handle these
ciuill quarrels, distinguish|ed
from iust, and foreine
warres, in order as they
fall.</P>

augmented the worst of e|uils

reuenged. The first, as it
were alter, which pleased

There being besieged by

<PB N="356" REF="192">
downe the rifts of the hol|low

the lowest rootes thereof,

daily so increasing; as that
now they were a full ar|my,
they make bucklers
of wouen osiars, couerd
with hides of beasts, and
<PB N="357" REF="192">
forge out the yron of their
worke-iayles into swords,
and tooles of warre. And
that no grace of a full hoste

they backe the horse which
they found at aduentures,
to raise a cauallery, and
brought to their captaine
the ensignes, and <HI>fasces</HI>
which were taken from our

to vse them, though of an

<PB N="361" REF="194">
would grieue me the lesse,
had the leaders of that
wickednesse bin base com|panions,
or if noblemen
borne, yet debosht in their
manners. But O the sinne!
what men! what chiefes!
when they were the orna|ments,
and glories of their
age, <HI>Marius</HI> and <HI>Sulla,</HI> who
vpheld that worst of hai|nous
euils with their vt|most
countenance. Things,
so to say, were planet|strucken
with three bad
influences; the first slight,
and little, and more <HI>pro|perly</HI>
a broyle, then a war,
the cruelty, such as it was,
staying among the cap|taines
of the quarell them|selues;
but the next was
<PB N="362" REF="195">
more grimme, and bloudy,
such as had the vpper hand
embrewing their weapons
in the bowels of all the <HI>Se|nate;</HI>
the third outwent, in
the rage thereof, not ciuill
only, but hostill furie, when
the madnesse of reuenge
had all the strengths of <HI>Ita|lie</HI>
to bolster it, their hatred
<HI>one of the other</HI> raging so
long, as till none were left
to kill. The beginning, and
cause of the warre, was the
insatiable thirst of honour
in <HI>Marius,</HI> while he labourd
by the law of <HI>Sulpitius</HI> to
take from <HI>Sulla</HI> his decreed
employment: but <HI>Sulla,</HI> im|patient
of the iniurie, forth|with
turned about with
the legions which were
<PB N="363" REF="195">
vnder his command, and
deferring <HI>the warre of Mi|thridates,</HI>
marcht into the
citie at port <HI>Esquiline,</HI> and
<HI>Colline</HI> gate in two great
battalions: from whence,
when <HI>Sulpitius,</HI> and <HI>Albi|nouanus</HI>
had suddenly re|pulsed
them, and logges, &amp;
stones, and tooles were
hurld vpon all sides from
off the walles, <HI>Sulla</HI> also
falls to throwing, openeth
his passage with fire, and
possesseth as a conquerour
the captiue <HI>Capitoll,</HI> that
fort which had escaped the
<HI>Paenish</HI>-men, yea and the
<HI>Galli Senones</HI> also. Then
by an act of the <HI>Senate,
Sulla's</HI> aduersaries proclai|med
enemies of the State,
<PB N="364" REF="196">
they had law on their side
to rage against the present
Tribune, and most of the
contrary faction. <HI>Marius</HI>
by seruill flight saued him|selfe,
or rather, fortune kept
him in store for another
warre. <HI>Cornelius Cinna,
Cnaeus Octauius</HI> Consuls, the
fire which was not well
put out rose afresh, and that
certainely by reason of the
disagreement, when it was
referred to the people,
whether such as the Senate
had proclaymed enemies
should bee recalled. They
came to this generall as|sembly
with their swords
about them: but they pre|uailing
who wished quiet|nesse,
<HI>Cinna,</HI> leauing the
<PB N="365" REF="196">
citie, posted to his party.
<HI>Marius</HI> returnes from <HI>A|frica,</HI>
the greater for ca|lamity,
because prison,
chaines, flight, and banish|ment
had endeare his dig|nitie.
At the name there|fore
of so great a man, there
is flocking to him from far,
and neere, bondmen (O
the hainousnesse!) &amp; stur|dy
rogues were armd: and
the distressed Generall easi|ly
found an army: so that,
as demanding restitution
to his countrey, out of
which he was expelled by
force, he might <HI>well</HI> seeme
to haue good reason for his
doing, had hee not <HI>other|wise</HI>
wrought his cause by
cruelty: but returning dis|contented
<PB N="366" REF="197">
with Gods and
men, the hauen-towne <HI>O|stia</HI>
a pupill, and foster-child
of <HI>Rome,</HI> was at the
first assault taken, and with
horrible destruction pilla|ged.
From thence he enters
the citie in foure battels,
<HI>Cinna, Marius, Carbo,</HI> and
<HI>Sertorius</HI> leading them,
where, after that the whole
band of <HI>Octauius</HI> was bea|ten
from mount <HI>Ianiculum,</HI>
presently, vpon a signe
giuen, they fell to killing
the princes, and chiefe
lords, much more sauagely
then is vsed either in a
<HI>Paenish,</HI> or a <HI>Cimbrian</HI> citie.
The head of <HI>Octauius,</HI>
Consul, was pitcht vpon a
pole before the <HI>Rostra,</HI> and
<PB N="367" REF="197">
the head of <HI>Antonius,</HI> a
Consularie man, was set on
the boord before <HI>Mari|us</HI>
himselfe: <HI>Casar,</HI> and
<HI>Fimbria</HI> were murthred
in that place of their
houses where their house|hold
Gods stood, <HI>and
Crassus</HI> the father, and
son, each insight of other.
<HI>Bebius,</HI> and <HI>Numitor</HI> were
drawne with the hang|mans
hookes through the
middle of the <HI>Forum. Ca|tulus</HI>
freed himselfe from
being made the scorne of
his enemies by smothe|ring.
<HI>Merula, Iupiters</HI>
priest, bespurtled the eyes
of <HI>Ioue</HI> himself, with the
bloud which sprung out
of his veines in the Capi|tol.
<PB N="368" REF="198">
<HI>Ancharius</HI> was runne
through, <HI>Marius</HI> himselfe
looking on, because when

reacht not out forsooth
that fatall hand of his.
These Senators he massa|cred
between the <HI>Calends,</HI>
and <HI>Ides</HI> of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> in that
seuenth Consulship of his.
What would haue become
of things, if <HI>after that pro|portion
of killing</HI> hee had
beene Consul but a yeere?
<HI>Scipio,</HI> and <HI>Norbanus</HI> Con|suls,
that third worst whirl|winde
of ciuill surie thun|dred
forth with all the vi|olence
it had; at which
time seuen legions of the
one side, on another fiue
hundred cohorts stood in
<PB N="369" REF="198">
armes, and <HI>Sulla</HI> hastned
out of <HI>Asia</HI> with a victori|ous
army. And certaine|ly,
<HI>Marius</HI> hauing shewed
himselfe so mercilesse to|wards
<HI>Sulla's</HI> friends, how
great cruelty was there
neede of, for <HI>Sulla</HI> to bee
euen with <HI>Marius?</HI> Their
first encounter was at
<HI>Capua</HI> by the riuer <HI>Vul|turnus,</HI>
and there the ar|my
of <HI>Norbanus</HI> was quick|ly
ouerthrowne, and all
<HI>Scipio's</HI> forces, vpon co|lourable
ouerture of
peace, speedily oppressed.
Then <HI>Marius</HI> the yonger,
and <HI>Carbo,</HI> Consuls, as if
the hope they had to get
the victorie were quite
dead, yet not to perish vn|reuenged,
<PB N="370" REF="199">
they parentated
to themselues with the
bloud of the Senate. And
besetting the Senate-house,
such of the Senate,
whose throats they meant
to cut, were drawne out
from thence, as out of a
<HI>sheep-penne, or</HI> prison.
What slaughters were
there in the <HI>Forum,</HI> in
the <HI>Circus,</HI> and open
Temples? For MVTIVS
SCAEVOLA, the priest,
embracing the altar of
<HI>Vesta</HI> in his atmes, is onely

<HI>Lamponius,</HI> and <HI>Telesinus,</HI>

waste <HI>Campania,</HI> and <HI>Etru|ria</HI>
more dreadfully then
<HI>Pyrrhus</HI> and <HI>Annibal</HI> did,

and vnder the colour of

The whole forces

distrest at <HI>Sacriport,</HI> and
port <HI>Collin,</HI> or <HI>Hill-gate.</HI>
There <HI>Marius,</HI> and here
<HI>Telesinus</HI> were destroyed.
But warre, and slaughter
ended not together. For
the sword was vnsheathed
euen in peace, and they
who freely yeelded them|selues,
were also depriued
of their liues. It is not
lesse <HI>hainous,</HI> that <HI>Sulla,</HI> at
<HI>Sacriport</HI> and <HI>Hill-gate,</HI>
did cut in pieces aboue
threescore and ten thou|sand.
But then it was war.
Hee commanded aboue
foure thousand vnarmed
<PB N="372" REF="200">
citizens, who had yeelded
themselues, to bee put to
the sword in the publike
village. These <HI>though</HI> so
many <HI>slaine</HI> in cold bloud,
yet are no more <HI>then foure
thousand.</HI> But who can
number them who were
kill'd euery-where tho|rowout
the citie by any
one who lifted? till <HI>Furfi|dius</HI>
admonished, that
some ought to bee left a|liue,
that there might be o|uer
whom to commaund.
Hereupon was that huge
table hung out, in which
two thousand <HI>by name,</HI>
cull'd forth of the very
flowre of the Senate,
knights, and gentlemen,
were proclaimed to die.
<PB N="373" REF="200">
A new kinde of edict. It

discouered the same by his
diligence, the other con|founded
it by force. The
intelligence of this so vast a
treason was giuen by <HI>Ful|uia,</HI>
a base cheape trull, but
not so wicked as to be guil|tie
of paricide. Then <HI>Cicero</HI>
the <HI>Consull,</HI> calling a Senate,
made an oration against the
hainous traytor to his face,
against the guiltie person
there in presence, but
wrought no greater effect
then <HI>onely</HI> to make the foe
shift for himselfe, and open|ly
professing to bee such,
threatned to put out the
fire with pulling downe all.

So he departs to the armie
which <HI>Manlius</HI> had prepa|red
in <HI>Etruria,</HI> with pur|pose
to assaile the citie. <HI>Len|tulus,</HI>
diuining that himself
was the man of his family,
to whom soueraigntie was
destinated in <HI>Sibylls</HI> verses,
had in fit places, against the
set day, dispersed men, fire|workes,

the whole citie: nor con|tented
with complices at

of the <HI>Allobroges,</HI> at
that time, as it hapned, in

<HI>stirre their nation</HI> to armes:
and the frensie had gadded

discouerie made by
<HI>Vulturius,</HI> the letters of the

Praetor had not beene atta|ched

were hereupon forthwith
laid, at <HI>Cicero's</HI> commande|ment,
vpon the <HI>Allobro|ges:</HI>
and the practice was o|penly
proued against <HI>Len|tulus</HI>
in the Senate. It be|ing
put to the question
what should be done with
the malefactors, <HI>Caesar</HI> was
of opinion, their liues
should be spared, because
they were persons of great
honor: <HI>Cato</HI> censur'd them
to death for their treason:
which opinion was secon|ded
by all, and they were
strangled accordingly in
prison. Though thus a
part of the conspiracie was
choakt, yet <HI>Catiline</HI> desi|sted
<PB N="389" REF="208">
not from his enterprise,
but with ensignes spred
marcheth out of <HI>Etruria,</HI> a|gainst
his natiue countrey,
and encountred on the way

How grimly they fought,
the euent sheweth: not a
man of the enemies was
left, and looke what place
each one fought in, vpon
the same he lost his life, and
couerd it with his body.
<HI>Catiline</HI> was found starke

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The warre of CAESAR, and
POMPEY.</HEAD>
<P>_THe whole world
almost being now
in peace, the <HI>Ro|man</HI>
empire was greater
then that it could be extin|guisht
by any foraine vio|lence.
Fortune therefore
beating enuie to that peo|ple,
which was soueraigne
of al other, armd their own
selues to their owne destru|ction.
The madnesse of
<HI>Marius,</HI> and <HI>Ginna</HI> confi|ned
it-selfe within the ci|tie,
as if shee tride how it
would doe; the tempest of
<HI>Sulla</HI> spred wider, yet did
<PB N="391" REF="209">
it not thunder out of <HI>Italy;</HI>
but the furie of <HI>Caesar,</HI> and
<HI>Pompey</HI> did hurrie, &amp; sucke
into it both the citie, <HI>Italy,</HI>
races, nations, &amp; in a word
the vniuersall empire, with
a kind as it were of deluge,
and gulph of fire, so farre
forth, that it cannot right|ly
bee onely called a ciuill,
neither yet a sociall, no nor
a foraine, but rather a cer|taine,
common of all toge|ther,
and more then a war.
For if wee looke vpon the
captaines, the whole <HI>Senate</HI>
was in sides; if the armies,
on the one part eleuen le|gions,
on the other, eigh|teen,
the flower, &amp; strength
<HI>together,</HI> of <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Italian</HI>
bloud; if the aides of the
<PB N="392" REF="210">
confederates, on this side,
the choise of the <HI>Galls,</HI> &amp;
<HI>Germans,</HI> on that, <HI>Deiota|rus,
Ariobarzanes, Tarcon|dimotus,
Cothus,</HI> the whole
powers of <HI>Thrace, Cappa|docia,
Cilicia, Maccdonia,
Greece, Italy,</HI> and all the
Orient; if the space of the
warre, foure yeeres, and
that, considering the de|structions
it wrought, but
a short time; if the place,
and flage, vpon which it
was acted, <HI>Italy,</HI> fro~ whence
it turn'd it selfe into <HI>Gall,</HI>
and <HI>Spaine,</HI> and fetching a
compasse from the west,
it sat down with the whole
burthen thereof vpon <HI>Epi|rus,</HI>
and <HI>Thessaly;</HI> thence it
crosseth suddenly into
<PB N="393" REF="210">
<HI>Aegypt;</HI> then it glanced
into <HI>Asia,</HI> and lay heauy
vpon <HI>Africk;</HI> last of all, it
reel'd back into <HI>Spaine,</HI> and
there at length it went
out, and died. But the
warre, and hatred of the
factions ended not toge|ther.
For that rested not, til
the rancour of the con|quer'd
parties had in the
heart of the citie, &amp; middle
of the Senate, satisfide it
self with the bloud of their
conquerour. The cause
of so monstrous mischiefs
was the same, which it v|seth
to be of al, too too
much prosperity. For <HI>Q.
Metellus,</HI> and <HI>Lucius Afra|nius,</HI>
Consuls, when the
maiestie of <HI>Rome</HI> preuailed
<PB N="394" REF="211">
through the world, and
the people chanted the
fresh victories <HI>of Pompey,</HI>
the <HI>Pontick,</HI> and <HI>Armenian</HI>
triumphs, in <HI>Pompeis</HI> thea|ters,
his ouer-great power
(as it often falleth out) mo|ued
enuy among the leysu|rable
citizens, <HI>Metellus</HI> for
abatement of his triu~ph o|uer
<HI>Crete, Cato,</HI> who alwaies
ranne bias to the mighty,
detracted <HI>Pompey,</HI> &amp; found
fault with his actions. The
griefe hereof draue him a|wrie,
and compelled him
to prouide strengths for
vpholding his dignitie. It
hapned <HI>Crassus</HI> at that
time flourished in honour
of bloud, riches, and au|thoritie,
and yet still coue|ted
<PB N="395" REF="211">
more. The name of
<HI>Caius Caesar</HI> was vp, for e|loquence,
and spirit, and
had the honour of a Con|sulship.
But <HI>Pompey</HI> o|uertopt
them both. <HI>Caesar</HI>
therefore struggling to get
dignity, <HI>Crassus</HI> to increase
it, <HI>Pompey</HI> to keepe what
he had, and all of them a|like
greedie of great
power, easily made a match
to set vpon the common|weale.
Therefore, while
each of them vseth the o|thers
strengths for his own
glory, <HI>Caesar</HI> inuaded <HI>Gall,
Crassus&punc; Asia, Pompey Spain,</HI>
three most puissant armies.
And thus the whole world
was now become to bee
held by three princes in
<PB N="396" REF="212">
partnership. This domina|tion
wore out ten yeeres
time. From that time for|ward,
because til then they
were ballanced among the~|selues
through a mutuall
feare, vpon the slaughter of
<HI>Crassus</HI> by the <HI>Parthians,</HI>
and the death of <HI>Iulia, Cae|sars</HI>
daughter, who marry|ing
to <HI>Pompey,</HI> maintained
concord between the son,
and father in law, by the
league of nuptial loue, emu|lation
brake forth present|ly.
<HI>Pompey</HI> now was iea|lous
of <HI>Caesars</HI> greatnesse,
and <HI>Caesar</HI> badly endured
<HI>Pompeis</HI> supereminencie.
The one brookt no equall,
the other no superior. But
O the sinne! they stroue in
<PB N="397" REF="212">
such sort for principality,
as if so great a fortune of
empire had not beene en|nough
for two. Therefore
<HI>Lentulus,</HI> and <HI>Marcellus</HI>
being Consuls, and the af|fiance
of the first pact <HI>a|mong
them</HI> once broken,
the <HI>Senate</HI> consulted to dis|employ
<HI>Caesar,</HI> and <HI>Pompey</HI>
labour'd the same; nor was
<HI>Caesar</HI> himselfe against it, if
in the first comitiall as|sembly,
or choise-moot,
there had beene respect
had of him, for the Con|sulship;
which <HI>honour</HI> ten
Tribunes had with <HI>Pom|peis</HI>
good liking decreed
him in his absence, and was
afterwards, vpon <HI>Pompeis</HI>
dissembling, denyed it. He
<PB N="398" REF="213">
should haue come, &amp; sued
for it after the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">more maio|rum.</NOTE> old wont.
On the other side, hee ear|nestly
demanded executi|on
of the decree, &amp; would
not cashier his armie, vn|lesse
they at home were as
good as their word <HI>to him.</HI>
For this cause he was pro|claimed
enemy. <HI>Caesar,</HI>
throughly nettled at the
newes, resolued to main|taine
with the sword, the
rewards of his sword. The
first field, &amp;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">arena.</NOTE> Sand-plot of
ciuil war was <HI>Italy;</HI> whose
castels <HI>Pompey</HI> had furnisht
with slight-garrisons. But
all of them were as it were
ouerwhelmed with <HI>Caesars</HI>
sudden comming-on. The
first alarm was sounded at
<PB N="399" REF="213">
<HI>Ariminu~.</HI> Then was <HI>Libo</HI>
more the~ al <HI>Etruria, Ther|mus</HI>
then <HI>Vmbria, Domiti&abus;</HI>
then <HI>Corfinium.</HI> And the
war had bin made an end
of without bloud, if, as hee
attempted it, he could haue
oppressed <HI>Pompey</HI> at <HI>Brun|disium.</HI>
But he escaped by
night through the closures
of the besieged hauen. A
shamful matter to be spoke~:
the late president of the Se|nat,
vmpire of peace, &amp; war,
fled in a torne, &amp; almost na|ked
vessell, ouer that sea,
which himself had triu~pht.
Nor is <HI>Pompey</HI> sooner driue~
out of <HI>Italy,</HI> then the Senat
out of the citie, into which
almost empty of people
throgh feare, <HI>Caesar</HI> entring
<PB N="400" REF="214">
made himself Consul. The
sacred <HI>inmost</HI> treasury, be|cause
the Tribunes op'ned
it somewhat too slowly, he
co~manded to be broken vp:
&amp; violently seis'd the reue|new,
and patrimony of the
people of <HI>Rome,</HI> sooner then
he did the soueraignty. <HI>Po~|pey</HI>
driuen away, &amp; fled, he
had a more minde to take
order for <HI>securing</HI> the pro|uinces,
then to pursue him.
He kept <HI>Sicilia,</HI> &amp; <HI>Sardinia,</HI>
the <HI>publick</HI> pledges of corn,
by deputies, or lieutenants
generall: there was not an
enemy in <HI>Gall,</HI> himself had
made it all peace there. But
passing in perso~ against the
<HI>Pompeis</HI> in <HI>Spaine, Massilia</HI>
was so bold as to shut her
<PB N="401" REF="214">
gates. Poore <HI>Massilia,</HI>
while it would faine haue
peace, fel into a war, throgh
feare of warre. But because
it had strong walls, he com|manded
it should be taken
for him in his absence. A
<HI>Greekish</HI> citie, but which
more hardly then for the
name it had lopt bauins for
rampire, durst burn the en|gins
bent against it, and en|counter
<HI>vs</HI> at sea. But <HI>Bru|tus,</HI>
who had the charge of
the war, tamed them quite
both at land, &amp; sea: wher|upon
yeelding themselues,
they were stript out of all
they had, excepting that
(which they prized aboue
all) their <HI>common</HI> libertie.
<HI>Caesar's</HI> war in <HI>Spaine</HI> with
<PB N="402" REF="215">
<HI>Petreius,</HI> &amp; <HI>Afranius,</HI> lieu|tenants
generall to <HI>Cnaeus
Pompeius,</HI> was doubtfull,
various, and bloudy, at|tempting
to besiege their
campe at <HI>Ilerda</HI> by the ri|uer
<HI>Sicoris,</HI> and to thrust
betweene them, and the
towne. In the meane|while
by stopping the
stream, whichin the spring|time
vsed to swell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">verni flu|minis ob|undatione.</NOTE> they de|priued
him of victuals. So
his campe was assaulted
with famine, and the be|sieger
himselfe remain'd
as it were besieged. But
so soone as the water was
down,<NOTE PLACE="marg">sed vbi pax fluminis redit.</NOTE> he scowres the coasts
with fire, and sword, and
fiercely re-enforceth his
pursuit, &amp; ouertaking them
<PB N="403" REF="215">
vpon their retreate into
<HI>Celtiberia,</HI> hee drew a
trench about, and so com|peld
them to yeeld for
thirst. Thus was the hi|ther
<HI>Spaine</HI> taken in, and
the farther <HI>Spaine</HI> delayd
not. For what could one
legion do, when fiue could
doe nothing? <HI>Varro</HI> there|fore
of his owne accord gi|uing
way, the <HI>Gades,</HI> the
streights, the <HI>Ocean,</HI> and all,
followed the luckinesse of
<HI>Caesar.</HI> But fortune durst
doe somewhat against that
captaine in his absence, on
this side <HI>Illyricum,</HI> and in
<HI>Africa,</HI> as if his faire suc|cesses
were of purpose to
be styrped, and inter-wouen
with crosse accidents: for
<PB N="404" REF="216">
when <HI>Dolabella,</HI> and <HI>An|tonius</HI>
being commanded
by <HI>Caesar</HI> to guard the iawes
of the <HI>Adriaticke</HI> gulph,
and the one had pitcht his
camp vpon the <HI>Illyrian</HI>
shore, the other on the
<HI>Corcyrean, Pompey</HI> being
master then at sea, <HI>Octa|uius</HI>
his lieutenant gene|rall,
and <HI>Libo,</HI> with huge
numbers of mariners, clo|sed
them in vpon all hands,
and <HI>Antonius,</HI> despite of
his most resistance, was en|forced
to yeelde through
famin: and those long boats
sent to his aide by <HI>Basillus,</HI>
such as for lacke of ships
they were faine to shift
with, were taken as it were
in an hunting toyle, by a
<PB N="405" REF="216">
new stratagem of the <HI>Cili|cians</HI>
on <HI>Pompeis</HI> side, the
fastning of ropes vnder wa|ter:
but the tide comming
in, freed two of the vessels:
one of them which carryed
the <HI>Opitergins</HI> was entan|gled
in the cords, &amp; produ|ced
an effect worthy to be
commended with honour
to posterity: for a band of
scarce one thousand young
fellowes held play from
morning till night, against
the force of an whole ar|mie,
enuironing them on
all sides: and when by man|hood
they could finde no
way forth, at the encou|ragement
of <HI>Vulteius,</HI> their
Coronel, they slue one the
other. In <HI>Africke</HI> also, such
<PB N="406" REF="217">
like was the valour, and
aduersitie of <HI>Curio,</HI> who
sent by <HI>Caesar with commis|sion</HI>
to receiue that pro|uince,
&amp; proud for hauing
repulsed, and put <HI>Varus</HI> to
flight, was vnable to stand
the sudden comming-on
of king <HI>Iuba,</HI> and the caual|lerie
of the <HI>Mauritanians.</HI>
Hee might haue fled, but
shame perswaded him to
die together with that ar|my
which his temerity had
cast away. But fortune now
importunately demanding
to make scores euen, <HI>Pom|pey</HI>
had chosen <HI>Epirus</HI> for
the seate of war: nor was
<HI>Caesar</HI> slowe: for hauing
made all safe at his backe,
though it were the depth
<PB N="407" REF="217">
of winter, and so the sea|son
vnfit, yet hee embarkt
for battell; and encamping
at <HI>Oricum;</HI> when that part
of his forces which was left
behinde with <HI>Antonius,</HI> for
want of shipping staid with
the longest at <HI>Brundisium;</HI>
hee was so impatient, that
for fetching them, hee at|tempted
at midnight, and
in a frigat to venture ouer,
though the sea was terrible
rough. His words to the
master, afraid at so great a
danger, are not forgotten.
What fearest thou? thou
carryest <HI>Caesar.</HI> When all
the forces which either
side could make, were
drawne together, &amp; their
camps confronted each the
<PB N="408" REF="218">
other the generals gouernd
themselues by diffre~t cour|ses.
<HI>Caesar</HI> naturally fierce, &amp;
longing to dispatch, offers
battell, eggeth, and pro|uoketh
to it: one while by
besieging the camp, about
which his workes ran six|teene
miles (but what
could besieging hurt them,
who hauing the sea open,
abounded thereby with all
prouisions?) another while
with assaulting <HI>Dyrrhachi|um</HI>
in vaine (for the situati|on
of it made it inexpug|nable)
and besides all this,
with daily skirmishes, as
the enemie sallied forth (at
which time captain <HI>Sceua's</HI>
manhood was admired, in
whose target one hundred,
<PB N="409" REF="218">
&amp; twenty shot were found
sticking) now with sackage
of <HI>Pompeis</HI> confederate ci|ties,
as when hee wasted
<HI>Oricum,</HI> and <HI>Gomphi,</HI> and
other fortresses of <HI>Thessali,
Pompei,</HI> on the contrarie,
contriues delayes, and
wayes of putting of, that,
by closing the enemy on all
parts, hee might breake his
heart with lack of victuals,
and the violent humor of
his most fiery aduersarie
might coole, &amp; falter. This
wholsome counsell did not
long auaile the author&punc; the
soldier, hee blames lying
idle, confederates cry out
vpon delay, and the <HI>great</HI>
lords tax him with ambiti|on.
<HI>So the destinies thrusting
<PB N="410" REF="219">
thinges headlong on,</HI> in
<HI>Thessaly,</HI> and the cham|pain
fields of <HI>Philippi,</HI> cho|sen
for the place of fight,
the fortunes of <HI>Rome,</HI> the
world, and all mankinde
were set vpon a cast. The
people of <HI>Rome</HI> neuer saw
in one place together so
great forces, nor fortune so
many mighty persons at a
time. There were aboue
three hundred thousand
in both the armies, besides
the aides of kings, and Se|nators.
Signes of an immi|nent
downefall were neuer
more apparent; runnings
away of beasts ordaind for
sacrifice, swarmes of bees,
notable ouercastings of the
skie in day time. <HI>Pompey</HI>
<PB N="411" REF="219">
himselfe dreamt ouer|night,
that he heard a noise
in his <HI>owne</HI> theater <HI>at
Rome,</HI> sounding about him
in the nature of a mour|ning,
and in the breake of
day hee was seene (fie vn|luckie!)
before his maine
battel in a black vpper gar|ment
<HI>Caesars</HI> armie was ne|uer
more fresh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">pullo ami|culo.</NOTE> &amp; fuller of
spirit. The sound of the
charge came first from
<HI>Pompeis side,</HI> but the shot
from the other. The ia|uelin
of <HI>Crastinus,</HI> who
began the fight, was no|ted:
and being runne into
the <HI>gaping</HI> mouth with a
sword, and found dead
with it so, among the car|cases,
did by the nouelty
<PB N="412" REF="220">
it selfe of the wound, well
declare, with what choler,
and madnesse hee fought:
neither was the issue of the
battell lesse admirable: for
whereas <HI>Pompey</HI> had such
multitudes of horse, as hee
thought to circumuent <HI>Cae|sar</HI>
easily, himselfe was cir|cumuented:
for after they
had fought a long time vp|on
euen termes, and, at a
signe giuen them by <HI>Pom|pey,</HI>
his troupes of horse fell
on in flanke, the <HI>Germane</HI>
cohorts made so boystrous
an impression vpon the ri|ders,
that they seemd foot|men,
&amp; these to haue come
on horsbacke: the ouer|throw
of the light-armd
souldiers ensued vpon the
<PB N="413" REF="220">
slaughter of the flying hors|troupes:
then the terrour
striking farther, one com|panie
putting another into
rowt, the rest of the destru|ction
was made as it were
at a stroke. Nothing was
more the bane of that day,
then the hugenesse it-selfe
of the armie. <HI>Caesar</HI> was
much in that battell, and
halfe between souldier and
soueraigne: speeches of his
were ouer-heard as hee rid
vp, and downe; the one
bloudy, but according to
<HI>the</HI> Art <HI>of the sword,</HI> and
powerfull for gaining the
day, <HI>Souldiers, foine at the
face;</HI> the other tending to
vaine glorie, <HI>Souldiers, spare
our countrey-men;</HI> when his
<PB N="414" REF="221">
owne selfe <HI>notwithstanding</HI>
chased them. Happie <HI>Pom|pey,</HI>
for all this miserie, had
hee shared in the fortune of
his slaughtred armie: but
he ouer-liued his own glo|rie,
that with the more dis|honour
he might poste for
his life through <HI>Thessalian
Tempe;</HI> bee beaten from
<HI>Larissa;</HI> and vpon a forlorn
rocke of <HI>Cilicia,</HI> studie, whe|ther
he should flie into <HI>Par|thia,
Africa,</HI> or <HI>Aegypt;</HI>
briefely, that vpon the <HI>Pe|lusian</HI>
shore, by the com|mand
of a most vnworthie
king, by the counsell of gel|ded-men,
and (to take all
the misfortunes together)
that murthred by the
sword of <HI>Septimius,</HI> his fu|gitiue,
<PB N="415" REF="221">
vnder the eyes of his
wife, &amp; children, he should
conclude his dayes. Who
would thinke that the war
should not bee determined
with <HI>Pompeis</HI> life? But the
embers of the <HI>Thessalian</HI>
fire waxt much more hot,
and forceable then euer:
and in <HI>Aegypt</HI> there was
warre without <HI>any</HI> parta|kings
<HI>of ours:</HI> for when <HI>Pto|lomea,</HI>
king of <HI>Alexandria,</HI>
had committed the most
hainous act of all those o|ther
which were commit|ted
during the ciuill warre,
and had, by means of <HI>Pom|peis</HI>
head, settled his owne
termes with <HI>Caesar,</HI> fortune
casting about for a reuenge,
<HI>therby</HI> to appease the ghost
<PB N="416" REF="222">
of so great a potentate,
wanted not occasion. <HI>Cleo|patra,</HI>
that kings sister,
throwing herselfe at <HI>Caesars</HI>
feet, besought restitution
to her part of the realme.
To plead for her, came
the ladies beauty, which
was doubled by this, that
so rare a creature seem'd to
haue wrong, &amp; the hatred
born to the king himselfe,
who, in killing <HI>Pompey,</HI> gra|tifide
the fortune of the
<HI>contrarie</HI> faction, not <HI>Caesar,</HI>
against whom hee would
also, without all question,
haue dared as much, if it
would haue serued his
turn. Whe~ <HI>Caesars</HI> pleasure
therefore was, that shee
should bee restored to her
<PB N="417" REF="222">
kingdome, <HI>by as it were a
Gauelkind,</HI> he being forth|with
be-set in the palace
<HI>roial,</HI> by the same instru|me~ts
who murthred <HI>Pom|pey,</HI>
with wondrous valour,
&amp; a slender company, did
beare the brunt of a migh|ty
army. For, by firing the
next tenements, &amp; the <HI>Ar|senal,</HI>
he dislodged the ene|mie,
who plide him from
thence with shot. From
thence he suddenly escaped
to the penile of <HI>Pharus.</HI>
Beaten out of that, &amp; glad
to plunge into the sea, hee
got, with admirable good
fortune, to the next ships,
by swimming, fain to leaue
his robe in the waues, whe|ther
by chance, or of pur|pose,
<PB N="418" REF="223">
that the aduersarie
might pelt, &amp; mawl it with
stones, and shot, <HI>in stead of
him.</HI> Receiued at last a|mong
his own mariners, &amp;
assailing the enemy in all
quarters at once, hee paide
the ghost of his son in law
the vengeance due to it,
vpon that cowardly, and
trayterous nation. For
not onely the kings tutor,
<HI>Theodorus,</HI> (author of
the whole warre) but not
so much also as those
maskes of men, <HI>the Eu|nuchs,
Photinus,</HI> &amp; <HI>Ganyme|des,</HI>
flying by sea, and land,
came to euill ends. The
<HI>yong</HI> kings body was found
as it lay <HI>wallowed</HI> vnder
mud, <HI>and known</HI> by the ho|nor
<PB N="419" REF="223">
of a golden curace, or
brest plate vpon it. New stirs
were likewise in <HI>Asia, begun</HI>
in <HI>Pontus,</HI> fortune watching
as it were of set purpose,
to make this the end of
<HI>Mithridates</HI> kingdom, that
the father should bee con|quer'd
by <HI>Pompey,</HI> and the
sonne by <HI>Caesar.</HI> King
<HI>Pharnaces,</HI> rather vpon
trust of our discord, then
his owne valour, fell vpon
<HI>Cappadocia</HI> with an offen|siue
armie. But <HI>Caesar</HI> set|ting
vpon him, in <HI>onely</HI> one,
and that too (so to say) not
an whole battell, ground
him <HI>as it were</HI> to dust,
after the manner of light|ning,
which at one, and
the same moment of time,
<PB N="420" REF="224">
came, hit, and went away:
neither was it a vaine brag
which <HI>Caesar</HI> made of him|selfe,
that the enemie was
ouerthrowne <HI>there,</HI> be|fore
euer hee set eye vpon
him. Thus went matters in
forreine parts. But in <HI>A|frick,</HI>
the fight of <HI>Romans</HI>
with <HI>Romans</HI> was more
deadly, then <HI>it had beene</HI> in
<HI>Pharsalia.</HI> Hither the re|maines
of the shipwrackt
faction were driuen by a
certaine pang, or fit of fury:
nor would you call them
remaines, but a whole, and
entire warre. <HI>Pompeis</HI> for|ces
were rather scatterd
then consumed. His tra|gedy
made them more
solemne, and zealous to
<PB N="421" REF="224">
fight. Nor did the suc|ceeding
Generals degene|rate.
For <HI>Cato,</HI> and <HI>Scipio</HI>
founded full enough in the
place of <HI>Pompeis</HI> name. <HI>Iu|ba,</HI>
king of <HI>Mauritania,</HI>
made one in the quarrell,
forsooth that <HI>Caesar</HI> might
haue the more to conquer.
There was therefore no
difference, nor oddes be|tweene
<HI>Pharsalia,</HI> and
<HI>Thapsus,</HI> sauing that the
eagernesse of the <HI>Caesarians</HI>
was both the more, &amp; the
more sharpe, as chafing
that the war grew though
<HI>Pompey</HI> was dead. To bee
briefe, a thing which neuer
hapned till then, the trum|pets
sounded a charge,
through the souldiers for|wardnesse,
<PB N="422" REF="225">
without the
co~mandement of the Ge|neral.
The ouerthrow be|ganne
at <HI>Iuba,</HI> whose ele|phants
not <HI>throughly</HI> man|ned
to fight, and but lately
taken wilde out of the
woods, quite confounded
at the sudden shrilnesse,
forthwith dis-ranked their
friends army, &amp; made that
the captaines could not es|cape
by flying, all of them
comming to their ends re|markably.
For <HI>Scipio</HI> was
now gotten on ship-boord,
but his enemies ouerta|king
him, he ran his sword
thorow his owne belly; &amp;
one asking after him in
search, he answered in these
very words, <HI>The Generall is
<PB N="423" REF="225">
well. Iuba</HI> gotten into his
palace, after a royal ban|quet
made to <HI>Petreius,</HI> the
companion of his flight,
among his cuppes, and di|shes
call'd vpon him for a
killing. And <HI>Petreius</HI> had e|nough
of that both for the
king, and himselfe: so the
viands, halfe as it were ea|ten,
and the funerall mes|ses
swam mixt with roy|all,
and <HI>Roman</HI> bloud to|gether.
<HI>Cato</HI> was not at
this battell, but encam|ping
at <HI>Bagrada,</HI> hee
lay for defence of <HI>Vti|ca,</HI>
as at the other maine
fort, or barre of <HI>Afri|ca.</HI>
But hearing the defeat
of his partners, hee dal|lied
not at all, but (as it
<PB N="424" REF="226">
became a wiseman) did
euen ioyfully hasten his
owne death. For after hee
had embraced, and bidden
good night to his son, and
companions, hee reposed
himselfe awhile in his bed,
hauing perused by a light
<HI>Plato's</HI> booke of the Im|mortality
of the soule, and
then, about the first relee|uing
of the watch, vnshea|thing
his sword, hee there|with
thrust himselfe with
a re-enforced stroke into
the body. After which, the
physicians presumed to
wrong the braue man with
laying salues, which he per|mitted
till they were out
of the roome: but then hee
rashed them away, and the
<PB N="425" REF="226">
bloud following amaine, he
left his dying hands in the
very wound. Warre, and
sidings brake out againe, as
fresh, as if there had neuer
past a stroke in the quar|rell:
and by how much
the troubles in <HI>Africa</HI>
were beyond those in <HI>Thes|saly,</HI>
by so much <HI>Spaines</HI>
surpassed those in <HI>Africa;</HI>
&amp; the brother linesse of the
Generals drew exceeding
sauor to that side, when for
one <HI>Pompey</HI> there stood vp
two. The encounters ther|fore
were no where so ter|rible,
or hazardous. The
first conflict was in the very
mouth of the maine <HI>Ocean,
Varius,</HI> and <HI>Didius oppo|sitely</HI>
lieutenants generall.
<PB N="426" REF="227">
but the strife with the sea
it selfe, was sorer then that
of Fleete with Fleete: for
the <HI>Ocean,</HI> as it were to
chastize owne countrey|men
for their madnesse,
dasht <HI>indifferently</HI> of ei|ther
of their nauies in
pieces. What a ghastly,
and hideous sight was that,
when at one, and the same
instant, seas, stormes and
tackle fought together!
Adde to all this, the feare|full
situation of the place,
where the shores of <HI>Spain,</HI>
and <HI>Mauritania</HI> on this
coast, and on that, doe of|fer
in a manner to claspe,
and meete the sea both me|diterranean,
&amp; maine <HI>O|cean,</HI>
and <HI>Hercules</HI> pillars,
<PB N="427" REF="227">
<HI>opposite mountaines,</HI> hang|ing
ouer. At which time,
foule weather, and fierce
battell raged round about.
After this, both parts ran|ged
here &amp; there, employ|ing
themselues in the siege
of cities; whose case was
miserable, while betweene
the leaders of seuerall sides,
they smarted deepely for
their friendship with the
<HI>Romans.</HI> The last battell of
all was at <HI>Munda.</HI> Here the
fight was not answerable to
the felicity of other fights,
but doubtfull for a long
time, and discontentiue; so
as fortune plainely seemed
to deliberate vpon the do|ing
of some, I know not
what, thing. Certainely,
<PB N="428" REF="228">
<HI>Caesar</HI> himselfe was seene
before the armie sadder
then for his wont, whether
in regard of humane frail|ty,
or as suspecting that
the excesse of prosperi|tie
would not hold out al|wayes,
or as fearing the
same things which <HI>Pom|pey</HI>
found, so soone as once
he came to be what <HI>Pompey</HI>
was: but in the very battell
it selfe, after the armies had
with equall slaughter done
nothing for a long space
but kill, suddenly (the like
whereof no man liuing
could remember) in the
most heate of the fight,
there was a deepe silence
on both sides, as if they
were agreed&punc; this was euery
<PB N="429" REF="228">
ones coneit of it. Last of all,
which <HI>Caesar</HI> in foureteene
yeeres before had neuer
seene, the selected tride
band of his old souldiers
(an hainous matter) gaue
backe: so that although
they fell not as yet to flat
running away, nothing
was playner notwithstan|ding,
then that they re|sisted
more for pure shame,
then valour. <HI>Caesar</HI> there|fore
putting his horse from
him, ranne like a mad-man
into the head of the battell:
there hee staid such as were
shrinking, co~firming them,
and finally cried, and flew
through all the squadrons
with his eyes, and hands in
that perturbation, it is re|ported
<PB N="430" REF="229">
hee debated within
himselfe, what to doe with
himselfe, if the worst be|fell,
and his countenance
was, as of a man, who
meant to make his owne
hand his owne executio|ner,
had not fiue cohorts
of <HI>the Pompeian</HI> horse cros|sing
the battell, as sent by
<HI>Labienus</HI> to guard the
campe in danger, giuen a
semblant of flying: which
either <HI>Caesar</HI> did himselfe
beleeue, or cunningly lay|ing
hold vpon the occa|sion
of that seeming, char|ged
as vpon flyers, and did
thereby both put fresh spi|rit
into his owne people,
and did also daunt his e|nemies:
for his people
<PB N="431" REF="229">
thinking they had the vp|per
hand, followed the
more boldly, and the <HI>Pom|peians,</HI>
while they supposed
their fellowes ranne away,
did fall themselues to run|ning.
How great the slaugh|ter
was of the enemies, and
the wrath, and furie of the
victorious, may bee by this
coniectured: such as esca|ped
out of the field, beta|king
themselues to <HI>Munda,</HI>
and <HI>Caesar</HI> commanding
them to bee forth with be|sieged,
a rampire was made
by piling vp dead bodies,
dragg'd <HI>thither</HI> from all a|bout,
and fastned together
with speares and iauelins.
An abominable spectacle e|uen
among the barbarous.
<PB N="432" REF="230">
But <HI>Pompeis</HI> sonnes despai|ring,
in truth, of victorie,
<HI>Cnaeus Pompeius</HI> flying out
of the battell, and, woun|ded,
as he was, in the legge,
seeking to saue himselfe in
the desarts, and vnfrequen|ted
places, was ouertaken
at the towne <HI>Lauro,</HI> and
there (so little he as yet de|spaired)
was slaine by <HI>Pe|sennius</HI>
who had him in
chase. Meanewhile, for|tune
hid <HI>Sextus Pompeius</HI>
safe in <HI>Celtiberia,</HI> reserued
for other warres after <HI>Cae|sars</HI>
death. <HI>Caesar</HI> returnes
victorious home: the pomp
of his first triumph was
furnished from the <HI>Rhene,</HI>
and <HI>Rhone,</HI> and with the
image of the captiue <HI>Ocean</HI>
<PB N="433" REF="230">
in gold. The <HI>stuffe of the</HI>
second was bay-tree of
<HI>Aegypt;</HI> and, for shewes,
the images of <HI>Nile</HI> and <HI>Ar|sinoe,</HI>
and of the <HI>watch|towre
Pharus,</HI> as it burnt
<HI>in the top</HI> like a flaming bea|con.
The third was the
chariot of <HI>Pharnaces,</HI> and
<HI>the spoyles</HI> of <HI>Pontus.</HI> The
fourth represented king <HI>Iu|ba</HI>
and his <HI>Moores</HI> &amp; <HI>Spaine</HI>
twice conquered. <HI>Pharsalia,
Thapsus,</HI> and <HI>Munda</HI> (those
greater arguments, &amp; mat|ters
then ouer which hee
triumpht) were not men|tioned.
Here, for a while,
were weapons layd aside,
the following calme with|out
bloud, and <HI>the cruel|ties
of</HI> warre were made a|mends
<PB N="434" REF="231">
for with goodnesse:
not a man put to death by
commandement, except
<HI>Afranius,</HI> (for whom once
pardoning was enough)
and <HI>Faustus Sylla,</HI> because
<HI>Caesar</HI> had learnd to feare
him for his father in law,
and <HI>Pompeis</HI> daughter,
with her vncles by <HI>Sylla's</HI>
side: in this hee tooke care
to make posteritie secure.
His countrey therefore not
ingratefull, all sorts of ho|nours
were heaped vpon
this one prime man; ima|ges
about the temples; in
the theater a crowne deckt
with rayes; a chaire of state
in the Senate-house; a pina|cle
vpon his house top; a
month in the Zodiac; and
<PB N="435" REF="231">
besides all these, himselfe
proclaimed Father of his

<HI>Dictator:</HI> last of all (and it
was unknowne whether it
were with his good liking)
<HI>Antonius,</HI> Consull, the or|naments
of a king were
offred: all which prooued
but as ribbands, or trim|mings
of an host ordained
to be slaine in sacrifice. For
the mildnesse of this prince
was lookt vpon with enui|ous
eyes, and the power it
selfe, which conferred be|nefits,
was to free mindes
cumbersome. Nor was the
forbearance of him an ac|quitall
any longer: for <HI>Bru|tus,</HI>
and <HI>Cassius,</HI> and other
<HI>Patricians, Lords of the
<PB N="436" REF="232">

assassinate him. How great
is the force of fate! the con|spiracy
was knowne far a|broade;
a scroll was giuen
also to <HI>Caesar</HI> himselfe, vpon
the very day <HI>of the fact;</HI> &amp;
though an hundred beasts
were sacrificed, yet not one
of them had any signe of
luckines. He came into the
Senate-house with a mea|ning
to aduance a warre a|gainst
the <HI>Parthians:</HI> there
the Senators stabd at him,
as he sat in his court-chair, &amp;
with twenty three wounds
he was driue~ to the ground.
So, he who had embrewed

How sauage those crafty

weapons, pasht their

barres, themselues wrapt

the waters, and enemies
empeaching him, as our

retired themselues

The armours of the

How wilde, and grimme

or little harth

they shewed their wood
rage in their very bondage

gnaw their chaines in sun|der

punisht their owne wilde|nesse.
The <HI>Dacians</HI> keepe

<PB N="481" REF="254">
<HI>Caesar Au|gustus</HI>

Sending <HI>Lentulus</HI> there|fore

<HI>Drusus,</HI> sent into

diuided the prey by bar|gaine

<HI>Bonna,</HI> and <HI>Gelduba</HI> toge|ther
with bridges, and
strengthened them with
shipping. Hee opened the
<HI>Hercinian</HI> wood, till that
time pathlesse, and vn|seene.
To conclude, such
was the peace in <HI>Germany,</HI>
that the men seemed not
the same men, the soile see|med
<PB N="485" REF="256">
other then it had bin,
and the ayre it selfe more
milde, and temperate then
euer. And that most gallant
yong gentleman (I call him
not so, out of flatterie, but
as he well deserued) dying
there, the Senate, which it
neuer had done to any o|ther,
surnamed him of <HI>Ger|manie,
Germanicus.</HI> But it
is more difficult to keepe
a prouince, then to con|quer
it. Prouinces are at|chieued
by the sword, but
retayned by iustice. Ther|fore
that reioycement was
short. For the <HI>Germans</HI>
were rather ouercome
then tamed, and vnder
Generall <HI>Drusus</HI> they ra|ther
admitted our customs,
<PB N="486" REF="257">
then submitted to our for|ces.
When hee was once
dead, they beganne to hate
the lawlesse humour, and
pride of <HI>Quintilius Varus</HI>
no otherwise, then as they
would haue hated cru|eltie.
But hee durst set
vp a Law-Court, and
sit in iudgement within
his campe, as if hee had
beene able to restraine
the violence of the bar|barous,
with his serieants
roddes, and cryers voice.
But they, who now a
good while since had seene
their blades canker'd with
rust, and their horse <HI>of
seruice</HI> growne foggie
with ease, no sooner saw
our gownes, and lawes
<PB N="487" REF="257">
more cruell then our
weapons, but they make
<HI>Arminius</HI> captaine, and
fall to armes. When <HI>Va|rus,</HI>
in the meane space, was
so aduenturous vpon trust
of peace, as hee tooke
no heed at all, though the
conspiracie of the captains
was foretold, and disclo|sed
to him by <HI>Segestes,</HI> a
prince among them. Ther|fore
(O strange securenes!)
as hee sat vpon the tribu|nal,
citing parties, they
at vnawares assaile him
on all hands, taken ab|solutely
vnprouided, and
fearing no such matter,
sacke his campe, and
destroy three legions. <HI>Va|rus</HI>
followed the vtter
<PB N="488" REF="258">
losse of things there, with
the same fate, and minde
that <HI>Paulus Aemilius</HI> did
the deadly blow at <HI>Cannae.</HI>
Nothing was more blou|die
then the slaughter
which was made through
the woods, and marshes;
nothing more intolerable
then the insultings of the
barbarous, specially against
pleaders at the bar, pluck|ing
out the eyes of some,
and lopping-off the hands
of other some; one had
his mouth stitcht-vp, af|ter
his tongue was first
cut out, which the sa|uage
<HI>actor</HI> grasping in his
hand, sayd to it: <HI>Thou
viper, at last giue ouer hiz|zing.</HI>
The body of the
<PB N="489" REF="258">
Consul himself, which the
souldiers had in their pie|tie
buried, was digged out
of his graue. The barba|rous
doe as yet withhold
two of our ensignes, &amp; two
of our eagles; the third
the eagle-bearer plucking
off, before the enemies layd
hand vpon him, and carry|ing
it <HI>hidden</HI> in the hollow
of his belt, was plunged so
into the bloudy marsh. By
this ouerthrow it came to
passe, that the course of em|pire
which had not stopt at
the <HI>Ocean,</HI> stayd vpon the
banke of <HI>Rhene.</HI> These
things hapned north-ward.
In the South of the world
there were rather hurly-burlies
then war. The <HI>Mu|sulanians,</HI>
<PB N="490" REF="259">
&amp; <HI>Gaetulians</HI> who
border vpon the <HI>Syrts,</HI> were
chastised by <HI>Cossus</HI> captain
generall, at <HI>Caesars</HI> com|mandement,
who was ther|fore
proper-named <HI>Gaetuli|cus.</HI>
The victory spreds wi|der.
Hee left the <HI>Marmari|ans,</HI>
&amp; <HI>Garamants</HI> for <HI>Fur|nius,</HI>
who subdued them: &amp;
might haue return'd <HI>entitu|led
Marmaricus,</HI> but that
his modesty rated not his
conquest so high. In the o|rient,
there was more to
doe with the <HI>Armenians.</HI>
Thither <HI>Caesar</HI> sent one
of his nephewes. Both
were of short life, and the
one of them inglorious.
For <HI>Lucius</HI> died of sicknes
at <HI>Massilia: Caius</HI> died
<PB N="491" REF="259">
in <HI>Lycia</HI> of a wound, as he
recouerd <HI>Armenia,</HI> with|drawing
it selfe to the <HI>Par|thians.
Pompey,</HI> hauing
vanquisht king <HI>Tigranes,</HI>
tide the <HI>Armenians</HI> to this
only poynt of bondage,
that they should haue no
gouernours but at our ap|pointment.
This right of
ours, hitherto intermitted,
was reuiued by <HI>Caius,</HI> not
without bloudshed, and
yet without much bicke|ring:
for <HI>Domnes,</HI> whom
the king had made gouer|nour
of <HI>Artaxat,</HI> faining
a reuolt, assailes him as he
was busie in perusing a
scroll, which himselfe had
reacht vnto him, preten|ding
it containd an account
<PB N="492" REF="260">
of the treasures; and with
his drawne sword, runnes
him into the forehead. but
the <HI>Barbarian</HI> was tilted at
on all sides by the armie,
who being destroyd with
sword, and fire, into which
hee threw himselfe woun|ded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">superstiti e|tiam non Caesari sa|tisfecit.</NOTE>
satisfied <HI>Caius</HI> ouer|liuing
<HI>him,</HI> but did not sa|tisfie
<HI>Caesar.</HI> In the west
part of the world, all <HI>Spain</HI>
was at quiet, excepting that
quarter which abutting
close vpon the rocks where
the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> mountaines
end, is washt with the hi|ther
<HI>Ocean.</HI> Here, two most
puisant nations, the <HI>Canta|brians,</HI>
and <HI>Asturians</HI> liued
free from command. the
<HI>Cantabrians</HI> were the more
<PB N="493" REF="260">
forward <HI>of the two,</HI> the
haughtier also, and stifer
in holding out a rebelli|on:
<HI>for</HI> not contented to
maintaine their owne free|dome,
they sought to en|croch
vpon their neigh|bours,
and wearied the
<HI>Vaccaeans, Curgonians,</HI> and
<HI>Autrigons,</HI> with often in|cursions.
against these men,
because they were said to
deale more outragiously
then ordinarie, <HI>Caesar</HI> com|manded
not an expedition
<HI>to be made by any other,</HI> but
went in person: came him|selfe
to <HI>Segisama;</HI> pitcheth
his camp; and from thence
euen then, diuiding his ar|mie
into diuers parts,
hemd all <HI>Cantabria</HI> about,
<PB N="494" REF="261">
and conquerd that wilde
nation, by inuironing them
as beasts within a toyle. nor
was the <HI>Ocean</HI> theirs: for
our army well-appointed
for warre, plaid vpon the
backs of the enemie. His
first battell against the <HI>Can|tabrians</HI>
was vnder the
walls of <HI>Vellica.</HI> from
hence they fled into that
most steep high mountaine
<HI>Vindius,</HI> whither they be|leeued
the waues of the <HI>O|cean</HI>
might as soone haue
clambred, as the <HI>Roman</HI>
armie. thirdly, the towne
<HI>Arracillum</HI> made great re|sistance,
but yet was taken
at the last. In the siege of
mount <HI>Edulius,</HI> about
which hee had drawne a
<PB N="495" REF="261">
trench of fifteene miles in
compasse, the <HI>Romans</HI>
mounted on all sides: and
when the barbarous saw
no possibilitie to escape,
their strife was who should
kill themselues first with
fire, and sword amidst their
feasts, or with poison, which
is commonly there scruzed
out of Tax-trees, and so
the greater part of them
deliuerd themselues from
that which seemd to them
captiuitie. <HI>Caesar</HI> had these
seruices done for him by
<HI>Antistius, Furnius,</HI> and <HI>A|grippa,</HI>
his deputies, while
himselfe wintred vpon the
sea-coasts of <HI>Tarracon.</HI> He
present in his owne person
at the doing, drew some
<PB N="496" REF="262">
of the vanquished from
dwelling on the mou~tains,
of some hee tooke hosta|ges,
and of others he made
slaues, and sold them vn|der
garlands. It seemed to
the Senate an action wor|thy
of laurell, and a chariot:
but <HI>Caesar</HI> was now at that
heighth, as he might con|temne
to triumph. About
the same time the <HI>Asturi|ans</HI>
came powring downe
from their mountaines in
an huge troupe, nor did
they stay their owne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">vt barbari impares.</NOTE> (as the
barbarous are vnruly) but
pitching their campe by
the riuer <HI>Astura,</HI> and, di|uiding
their force into three
armies, they prepared to
assaile three seueral camps
<PB N="497" REF="262">
of the <HI>Romans</HI> all at a time.
the fight had beene doubt|full,
and bloudy, and had
made an end of both parts,
they comming then, as
they did, so strong, so sud|denly,
and with such sound
deliberation, but that the
<HI>Brigaecins</HI> betrayd them,
by whom <HI>Carisius</HI> hauing
intelligence, he came vpon
them with an armie, and
destroyd their deuice, ne|uerthelesse,
the battell e|uen
so was not vnbloudy,
such as remained vnflaine
of that most puisant assem|bly,
retired themselues in|to
the citie <HI>Lancia:</HI> where
the fight was so sharpe and
hot, that when our souldi|ers
demanded leaue to set
<PB N="498" REF="263">
fire on the citie after it was
taken, the Generall could
hardly obtaine the fauour
at their hands, that it
might rather bee a moni|ment
of the <HI>Roman</HI> victo|ry,
standing, then burnt to
the ground. This was the
last warre of <HI>Augustus
Caesar,</HI> and the last rebellion
of <HI>Spaine.</HI> Constant allegi|ance,
and eternall peace
forthwith ensued, aswell
by reason of their owne
inclination more bent to
peace, as by <HI>Caesars</HI> cour|ses,
who fearing the bold|nesse
which mountaines
bred in them, commanded
them to inhabit <HI>from
thenceforth</HI> in those camps
of his which were vpon
<PB N="499" REF="263">
plaine ground. This be|gan
to bee found a matter
of high wisdome. The re|gion
round about was na|turally
full of gold-oare, of
vermilion, orpiment, and
other colours. Hee there|fore
commanded the grou~d
should bee searcht, and
wrought. For while the
<HI>Asturians</HI> digged their
owne treasures, and riches
which lay deepe hidden, to
serue others turnes, them|selues
also began to vnder|stand
their value. All the
West; and South of the
world being at peace, and
Northward also (excepting
onely the <HI>Rhene,</HI> and <HI>Da|babius)</HI>
as likewise in the
East, betweene <HI>Taurus,</HI>
<PB N="500" REF="264">
and <HI>Euphrates,</HI> those other
<HI>countreys</HI> who were free
from our power, had a fee|ling
notwithstanding how
great it was, &amp; reuerenced
the people of <HI>Romes</HI> victo|rie
ouer nations. For both
the <HI>Scythians</HI> sent their
ambassadours, and the <HI>Sar|matians</HI>
also, desiring
friendship. The <HI>Seres</HI>
moreouer, and the <HI>Indians</HI>
inhabiting right vnder the
Sunne it selfe, came with
precious stones, and pearls,
and dragging elephants al|so
along after them among
their presents, thought
not so much of any thing
as of the length of the
way, which tooke vp foure
yeeres trauell: and the <HI>very</HI>
<PB N="501" REF="264">
colour it selfe of the men
spake for them, that they
came from vnder as it were
another Sunne. The <HI>Par|thians</HI>
in like sort, as if they
repented their victorie, re|stored
of their owne ac|cord
the ensignes taken at
the destruction of <HI>Crassus.</HI>
So all mankinde had eue|ry-where
an entire, and
continuall either peace, or
paction. And <HI>Caesar Au|gustus</HI>
seuen hundred
yeeres from after the buil|ding
of <HI>Rome,</HI> durst shut
the Temple of double|faced
<HI>Ianus;</HI> twice onely
clozed before that time;
once vnder king <HI>Numa,</HI> and
the other time when the
first warre of <HI>Carthage</HI> was
<PB N="502" REF="265">
concluded. From hence|forth,
bending his minde
to peace, hee corrected ma|ny
things in the times
<HI>which were</HI> prone to all
mischiefe, and which ouer|flowed
in riotous loose|nesse,
with graue, and se|uere
edicts. For these so
many, and so wondrous
great deeds of his, hee was
called <HI>perpetual Dictator,</HI>
and <HI>Father of his Countrey.</HI>
It was also debated in the
Senate, whether, because
hee had founded the em|pire,
hee should bee styled
<HI>Romulus.</HI> But the name
<HI>Augustus</HI> seemed to bee a
more holy, and venerable
word <HI>then the other,</HI> that
so euen now while hee
<PB N="503" REF="265">
liued on the earth, hee
might bee <HI>as it were</HI> dei|fide
by the name it
selfe, and ti|tle.</P>
