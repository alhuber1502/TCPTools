          <P>A PAMPHLET has ju<g ref="char:s">s</g>t been reprinted here, which every per<g ref="char:s">s</g>on of ta<g ref="char:s">s</g>te attributes to you, and which no one can read without re<g ref="char:s">s</g>pecting its author. Your wi<g ref="char:s">s</g>hes are for peace, and you would per<g ref="char:s">s</g>uade the allied Powers not to <g ref="char:s">s</g>cruple purcha<g ref="char:s">s</g>ing it by very important conce<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ions. In your wi<g ref="char:s">s</g>hes all Europe will unite; but many, I believe, will think, with me, that the means which you propo<g ref="char:s">s</g>e for accompli<g ref="char:s">s</g>hing them would be productive of the mo<g ref="char:s">s</g>t dangerous con<g ref="char:s">s</g>equences. It is con<g ref="char:s">s</g>oling to <g ref="char:s">s</g>ee the milder af|fections <g ref="char:s">s</g>till cheri<g ref="char:s">s</g>hed in the bo<g ref="char:s">s</g>om of one of the <g ref="char:s">s</g>exes, while every thought of the other <g ref="char:s">s</g>eems bent on de<g ref="char:s">s</g>truction; but yet, a great deal too much is at <g ref="char:s">s</g>take to allow its being <g ref="char:s">s</g>acrificed to the impatience of an exce<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ive <g ref="char:s">s</g>en<g ref="char:s">s</g>ibility, who<g ref="char:s">s</g>e triumph could only be preparatory to the bittere<g ref="char:s">s</g>t regret.</P>
          <P>I am too confident, perhaps, in entering the li<g ref="char:s">s</g>ts again<g ref="char:s">s</g>t one who unites the <g ref="char:s">s</g>eduction of <g ref="char:s">s</g>entiment peculiar to her own <g ref="char:s">s</g>ex, with a courage in her political remarks which might rather be expected in the other,

and embelli<g ref="char:s">s</g>hes both with hereditary eloquence. But truth and facts are the be<g ref="char:s">s</g>t <g ref="char:s">s</g>upport of an argument, and will make up for any other di<g ref="char:s">s</g>parity between the di<g ref="char:s">s</g>putants.</P>
          <P>My purpo<g ref="char:s">s</g>e I hope will not be mi<g ref="char:s">s</g>taken. Indeed it will <g ref="char:s">s</g>oon appear that we really have both the <g ref="char:s">s</g>ame object; for who is there <g ref="char:s">s</g>o unfeeling as not anxiou<g ref="char:s">s</g>ly to wi<g ref="char:s">s</g>h for peace? not indeed a <g ref="char:s">s</g>u<g ref="char:s">s</g>picious and tem|porary <g ref="char:s">s</g>u<g ref="char:s">s</g>pen<g ref="char:s">s</g>ion of war, di<g ref="char:s">s</g>gui<g ref="char:s">s</g>ed under that name; but a peace equitable and durable, more <g ref="char:s">s</g>o than can po<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ibly be obtained by any conce<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ions on the part of the Allies.</P>
          <P>Meaning to confine my ob<g ref="char:s">s</g>ervations to the actual <g ref="char:s">s</g>ituation, and the pro<g ref="char:s">s</g>pects of the contending Powers, I <g ref="char:s">s</g>hall <g ref="char:s">s</g>ay nothing of the picture which you have <g ref="char:s">s</g>ketched with <g ref="char:s">s</g>o much <g ref="char:s">s</g>pirit of the errors of the Coalition again<g ref="char:s">s</g>t France; but merely ob<g ref="char:s">s</g>erve, that the view you exhibit of the errors committed by the combined Powers, will rather induce them to avoid <g ref="char:s">s</g>uch conduct in future, than tempt them to repeat it.</P>
          <P>
            <Q>I could wi<g ref="char:s">s</g>h to think <g ref="char:s">s</g>o (you may <g ref="char:s">s</g>ay); but, admitting that pa<g ref="char:s">s</g>t errors do not nece<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>arily lead to new di<g ref="char:s">s</g>grace, if you would intere<g ref="char:s">s</g>t us in the <g ref="char:s">s</g>ucce<g ref="char:s">s</g>s of the Allies, we mu<g ref="char:s">s</g>t fir<g ref="char:s">s</g>t know exactly what u<g ref="char:s">s</g>e they will make of it. Will they again think of di<g ref="char:s">s</g>membering France, of compelling an uncon|ditional <g ref="char:s">s</g>ubmi<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ion to the ancient <g ref="char:s">s</g>y<g ref="char:s">s</g>tem, and cha<g ref="char:s">s</g>|ti<g ref="char:s">s</g>ing tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e who de<g ref="char:s">s</g>troyed it? Will they again propo<g ref="char:s">s</g>e to bring back the emigrants in triumph to Paris, with their terrible train of vengeance, exclu<g ref="char:s">s</g>ive privileges, feudal rights, and partial taxation?</Q>
          </P>
          <P>All <g ref="char:s">s</g>uch ideas the events of the war have long <g ref="char:s">s</g>ince <g ref="char:s">s</g>hewn to be vi<g ref="char:s">s</g>ionary. For a long time the object has been to <g ref="char:s">s</g>ave Germany from being di<g ref="char:s">s</g>|membered; and to prevent the aggrandi<g ref="char:s">s</g>ement, in|<g ref="char:s">s</g>tead of attempting the partition, of France. The
<PB N="3" REF="048483_0004_10252F53D34C79B8" MS="N"/>
object has been to compel it to give back its con|que<g ref="char:s">s</g>ts, and to keep <g ref="char:s">s</g>o de<g ref="char:s">s</g>tructive a torrent within its proper limits: and, as probably the happine<g ref="char:s">s</g>s and peace of a century to come will principally depend on the equitable termination of the pre<g ref="char:s">s</g>ent conte<g ref="char:s">s</g>t, if the French cannot be conquered in the field, yet <g ref="char:s">s</g>till the war <g ref="char:s">s</g>hould be continued till ab<g ref="char:s">s</g>olute want com|pels them to retire within their ancient boundaries.</P>
          <P>You appear to believe that a <HI>formal acknowledgement</HI> of their Republic would remove all difficulties, di<g ref="char:s">s</g>|<g ref="char:s">s</g>ipate their fears, and lead to a general re<g ref="char:s">s</g>titution; and you think that the Briti<g ref="char:s">s</g>h Cabinet per<g ref="char:s">s</g>i<g ref="char:s">s</g>ts in wa<g ref="char:s">s</g>ting the blood and trea<g ref="char:s">s</g>ure of the nation, merely to <g ref="char:s">s</g>ave the Kings of Europe from the humiliation of <g ref="char:s">s</g>uch a decla|ration. Perhaps you have not heard that three months ago<NOTE N="*" PLACE="FOOT">January 26, 1795.</NOTE> Mr. Pitt him<g ref="char:s">s</g>elf moved and carried the following re<g ref="char:s">s</g>olution in the Hou<g ref="char:s">s</g>e of Commons: <Q>That, under the pre<g ref="char:s">s</g>ent circum<g ref="char:s">s</g>tances, the Hou<g ref="char:s">s</g>e of Commons feels it<g ref="char:s">s</g>elf called upon to declare its determination firmly and <g ref="char:s">s</g>teadily to <g ref="char:s">s</g>upport his Maje<g ref="char:s">s</g>ty in the vigorous pro<g ref="char:s">s</g>ecution of the pre<g ref="char:s">s</g>ent ju<g ref="char:s">s</g>t and nece<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ary war, as affording, at this time, the only rea<g ref="char:s">s</g>onable expectation of permanent <g ref="char:s">s</g>e|curity and peace to this country: and that, for the attainment of the<g ref="char:s">s</g>e objects, this Hou<g ref="char:s">s</g>e relies with equal confidence on his Maje<g ref="char:s">s</g>ty's intention to em|ploy vigorou<g ref="char:s">s</g>ly the force and re<g ref="char:s">s</g>ources of the country, in <g ref="char:s">s</g>upport of its e<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ential intere<g ref="char:s">s</g>ts; and on the de<g ref="char:s">s</g>ire uniformly manife<g ref="char:s">s</g>ted by his Maje<g ref="char:s">s</g>ty, to effect a pacification on ju<g ref="char:s">s</g>t and honourable grounds, <HI>with any Government in France, under whatever form,</HI> which <g ref="char:s">s</g>hall appear capable of maintaining the ac|cu<g ref="char:s">s</g>tomed relations of peace and amity with other countries.</Q></P>
          <P>Such has been, and <g ref="char:s">s</g>uch <g ref="char:s">s</g>till is, the language of Mr. Pitt. But though you have <g ref="char:s">s</g>aid a great deal of

            <HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
            <ARGUMENT>
              <P>Whether the War has really been more di<g ref="char:s">s</g>a<g ref="char:s">s</g>trous to the confederated Powers, than Neutrality would have been? Whether they ought to accede to any <g ref="char:s">s</g>ort of Treaty, which would leave the French in po<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>e<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ion of the <g ref="char:s">s</g>malle<g ref="char:s">s</g>t part of their Conque<g ref="char:s">s</g>ts? and whether the Chances of obtaining Re<g ref="char:s">s</g>titution, and of ultimate Succe<g ref="char:s">s</g>s in the pre<g ref="char:s">s</g>ent Conte<g ref="char:s">s</g>t, are not in favour of that Party which has the mo<g ref="char:s">s</g>t permanent Re|<g ref="char:s">s</g>ources?</P>
            </ARGUMENT>
            <P>BEFORE any di<g ref="char:s">s</g>cu<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ion of the principal point in di<g ref="char:s">s</g>pute, it will be convenient to di<g ref="char:s">s</g>entangle it from <g ref="char:s">s</g>ome que<g ref="char:s">s</g>tions which have a tendency to perplex it.</P>
            <P>I do not mean (any more than M—) <HI>to go back to the origin of the war,</HI> or to inve<g ref="char:s">s</g>tigate its ju<g ref="char:s">s</g>tice on the part of the two Princes who fir<g ref="char:s">s</g>t united in <g ref="char:s">s</g>upport of monarchy in France: I am afraid there is but too much rea<g ref="char:s">s</g>on to believe that it has con|tributed to lead to the <g ref="char:s">s</g>caffold the King, whom they wi<g ref="char:s">s</g>hed to confirm on his throne, and to make tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e very principles triumphant, which they intended to exterminate.</P>
            <P>But, whatever may be thought of preceding cir|cum<g ref="char:s">s</g>tances, it cannot be denied that Great Britain did not join the confederacy, until the principles of Anarchy were triumphant in France; until that nation
<PB N="6" REF="048483_0007_10252FB351A3ABB8" MS="N"/>
had avowed its project of di<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>eminating them univer|<g ref="char:s">s</g>ally, and until it had actually commenced ho<g ref="char:s">s</g>tilities again<g ref="char:s">s</g>t States with which Great Britain had defen<g ref="char:s">s</g>ive alliances. In ju<g ref="char:s">s</g>tice to the Briti<g ref="char:s">s</g>h Government, this circum<g ref="char:s">s</g>tance ought not to be overlooked; nor <g ref="char:s">s</g>hould we judge of <HI>the policy of its conduct, by the bad <g ref="char:s">s</g>uc|ce<g ref="char:s">s</g>s which has hitherto attended it;</HI> but by the actual <g ref="char:s">s</g>ituation of Europe, at the time when this country acceded to the confederacy; when the people were generally taught to look upon the French Revolution as reali<g ref="char:s">s</g>ing every airy vi<g ref="char:s">s</g>ion of political happine<g ref="char:s">s</g>s; while in truth it menaced mankind with a far more dreadful <g ref="char:s">s</g>courge than that under which we now <g ref="char:s">s</g>uffer. We <g ref="char:s">s</g>hould revert to the time when, in very many countries, the people <g ref="char:s">s</g>eemed advancing, from admiration of the French theories, to an impatience for putting them in practice. If, at <g ref="char:s">s</g>o dangerous a moment, there were State<g ref="char:s">s</g>men cool enough to re<g ref="char:s">s</g>i<g ref="char:s">s</g>t the general enthu<g ref="char:s">s</g>ia<g ref="char:s">s</g>m, who fore<g ref="char:s">s</g>aw the inevitable con<g ref="char:s">s</g>equence of tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e theories, and, in order to pre|vent it, adopted the bold mea<g ref="char:s">s</g>ure of drawing on their country towards an evil, di<g ref="char:s">s</g>tre<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ing no doubt, but neither unu<g ref="char:s">s</g>ual, nor without remedy, with a view to <g ref="char:s">s</g>ave it from the irreparable mi<g ref="char:s">s</g>chief of revo|lutionary anarchy—State<g ref="char:s">s</g>men wi<g ref="char:s">s</g>e enough to rou<g ref="char:s">s</g>e that popular zeal in defence of <g ref="char:s">s</g>ocial order, which el<g ref="char:s">s</g>e might have been <g ref="char:s">s</g>educed to <g ref="char:s">s</g>ubvert it; perhaps the gratitude of future ages will be in proportion to the courage with which they have dared to oppo<g ref="char:s">s</g>e the clamours of the day.</P>
            <P>The Author of the <HI>Reflections on Peace,</HI> however, bit|terly reproaches them for not knowing how to avoid the <g ref="char:s">s</g>courge of revolutionary principles, but by the <g ref="char:s">s</g>courge of war, in<g ref="char:s">s</g>tead of <HI>lowering all their <g ref="char:s">s</g>ails during the <g ref="char:s">s</g>torm.</HI> But before we decide whether it was be<g ref="char:s">s</g>t boldly to bear up again<g ref="char:s">s</g>t it, or to let the ve<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>el drive before it, at the mercy of the waves, the bur<g ref="char:s">s</g>ting out of the <g ref="char:s">s</g>torm <g ref="char:s">s</g>hould be con<g ref="char:s">s</g>idered. This
<PB N="7" REF="048483_0008_10252FBCEEA16890" MS="N"/>
<g ref="char:s">s</g>ame writer calls it <HI>a new aera.</HI> It was indeed a time, when an unheard-of and mo<g ref="char:s">s</g>t dangerous doc|trine was zealou<g ref="char:s">s</g>ly propagated with a <g ref="char:s">s</g>ort of philo|<g ref="char:s">s</g>ophic parade, which fa<g ref="char:s">s</g>cinated many even of the thinking part of the world; and when con<g ref="char:s">s</g>e|quently it became the duty of tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e who fore<g ref="char:s">s</g>aw the mi<g ref="char:s">s</g>chief, to give a contrary direction to popular enthu<g ref="char:s">s</g>ia<g ref="char:s">s</g>m. If this <g ref="char:s">s</g>o-much-blamed war, for which the French gave <g ref="char:s">s</g>uch ju<g ref="char:s">s</g>tifying provocation, or, if you in<g ref="char:s">s</g>i<g ref="char:s">s</g>t upon it, <g ref="char:s">s</g>o <g ref="char:s">s</g>pecious a pretence, has kept their neighbours under the re<g ref="char:s">s</g>traint of law, prevented turbulence by giving employment, and <g ref="char:s">s</g>trengthened the exi<g ref="char:s">s</g>ting governments, by uniting in their defence tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e active <g ref="char:s">s</g>pirits, which el<g ref="char:s">s</g>e might have been united for their de<g ref="char:s">s</g>truction:—if, which is indi<g ref="char:s">s</g>|putable, this political pe<g ref="char:s">s</g>tilence has already co<g ref="char:s">s</g>t France ten times more lives than all the nations of Europe together have lo<g ref="char:s">s</g>t, in defending them<g ref="char:s">s</g>elves from it by war:—but beyond all other con<g ref="char:s">s</g>idera|tions, if the Briti<g ref="char:s">s</g>h Con<g ref="char:s">s</g>titution has triumphed, and will de<g ref="char:s">s</g>cend unchanged to po<g ref="char:s">s</g>terity;—I am con|vinced that future ages will look on the <g ref="char:s">s</g>acrifices of the pre<g ref="char:s">s</g>ent day, as <HI><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignal benefits.</HI>—Bloody they are, no doubt, and calamitous; but infinitely le<g ref="char:s">s</g>s <g ref="char:s">s</g>o than the <HI>poi<g ref="char:s">s</g>oned pre<g ref="char:s">s</g>ent</HI> of the revolutionary <g ref="char:s">s</g>y<g ref="char:s">s</g>tem which the French have offered to the world.</P>
            <P>If it is <g ref="char:s">s</g>aid that the nations which have not made <g ref="char:s">s</g>uch bloody <g ref="char:s">s</g>acrifices to internal tranquillity, have neither felt the mi<g ref="char:s">s</g>chiefs of war, nor been infected with this revolutionary contagion; I would a<g ref="char:s">s</g>k what advantages tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e nations which are within the gra<g ref="char:s">s</g>p of France have found, from a di<g ref="char:s">s</g>po<g ref="char:s">s</g>ition to neutrality? Was it any <g ref="char:s">s</g>ecurity to Savoy, Holland, or the Palatinate? But waving what might be <g ref="char:s">s</g>aid re<g ref="char:s">s</g>pecting them, I wi<g ref="char:s">s</g>h to con<g ref="char:s">s</g>ider what has really been the <g ref="char:s">s</g>ituation of tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e other neutral States (<g ref="char:s">s</g>o exclu<g ref="char:s">s</g>ively <HI>fortunate</HI>) to which the war has not reached, who<g ref="char:s">s</g>e <HI>wi<g ref="char:s">s</g>dom and happine<g ref="char:s">s</g>s</HI> is <g ref="char:s">s</g>o greatly

If we read his works, we <g ref="char:s">s</g>hall find, that it was only by an admirable management of his revenues, and by his care to have always new re<g ref="char:s">s</g>ources in re<g ref="char:s">s</g>erve, that he was able to <g ref="char:s">s</g>up|port, for <g ref="char:s">s</g>even <g ref="char:s">s</g>ucce<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ive years, and at la<g ref="char:s">s</g>t to ter|minate with glory, a conte<g ref="char:s">s</g>t full of di<g ref="char:s">s</g>a<g ref="char:s">s</g>ters, and during which his enemies overran the whole of his dominions. When at la<g ref="char:s">s</g>t he obliged them to re|treat, and to re<g ref="char:s">s</g>tore all that they had taken from him, it was becau<g ref="char:s">s</g>e they felt an inability to per<g ref="char:s">s</g>i<g ref="char:s">s</g>t in the war, the nece<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ary con<g ref="char:s">s</g>equence of exhau<g ref="char:s">s</g>ted re<g ref="char:s">s</g>ources; while, with a fore<g ref="char:s">s</g>ight which <g ref="char:s">s</g>ecured <g ref="char:s">s</g>ucce<g ref="char:s">s</g>s, the great abilities of Frederic had been directed as much to recruit his trea<g ref="char:s">s</g>ures as his armies.</P>
            <P>It is true, that when the means of war altogether depended on the accumulation of trea<g ref="char:s">s</g>ure, its duration might be more ea<g ref="char:s">s</g>ily be calculated beforehand than now, that nations have di<g ref="char:s">s</g>covered the dangerous <g ref="char:s">s</g>ecret of charging its expences on unborn gene|rations,

by additional debts. But <g ref="char:s">s</g>till, if, in com|paring the <g ref="char:s">s</g>trength of contending Powers, we add to their exi<g ref="char:s">s</g>ting re<g ref="char:s">s</g>ources, tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e which are derived from credit, we may foretell with <g ref="char:s">s</g>ufficient certainty which of them will ultimately be the mo<g ref="char:s">s</g>t powerful, and con<g ref="char:s">s</g>equently which has the be<g ref="char:s">s</g>t rea<g ref="char:s">s</g>on to expect <g ref="char:s">s</g>ucce<g ref="char:s">s</g>s from per<g ref="char:s">s</g>everance. In the pre<g ref="char:s">s</g>ent war, there|fore, before a thought is admitted on the part of the Allies of buying a peace by <g ref="char:s">s</g>acrifices, which mu<g ref="char:s">s</g>t nece<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>arily render it in<g ref="char:s">s</g>ecure; before we give way to de<g ref="char:s">s</g>pondency, we <g ref="char:s">s</g>hould examine whether our antagoni<g ref="char:s">s</g>t is not much nearer the end of his trea<g ref="char:s">s</g>ures and his credit than we are; whether the di<g ref="char:s">s</g>tre<g ref="char:s">s</g>s re<g ref="char:s">s</g>ulting from this circum<g ref="char:s">s</g>tance does not more than counterbalance any victory in the field; and whe|ther, in <g ref="char:s">s</g>pite of his wide-extended acqui<g ref="char:s">s</g>itions, he is not on the point of being in a <g ref="char:s">s</g>ituation to <g ref="char:s">s</g>ay with Pyrrhus, <HI>One victory more, and I am undone.</HI></P>
            <P>An object then at pre<g ref="char:s">s</g>ent of the greate<g ref="char:s">s</g>t import|ance, is to compare the military re<g ref="char:s">s</g>ources, or, which in truth is the <g ref="char:s">s</g>ame thing, the finances and the credit of France with tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e of Great Britain; for it is from <g ref="char:s">s</g>uch a compari<g ref="char:s">s</g>on only that we can decide whether the latter ought to make any conce<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ion for the <g ref="char:s">s</g>ake of peace.</P>

            <ARGUMENT>
              <P>That at pre<g ref="char:s">s</g>ent the only Re<g ref="char:s">s</g>ource of France is her A<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats, on which even her future military exertions mu<g ref="char:s">s</g>t exclu<g ref="char:s">s</g>ively depend; which are depreciating with a continually accelerating pro|gre<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ion, and in a <g ref="char:s">s</g>hort time mu<g ref="char:s">s</g>t inevitably be of no value whatever.</P>
            </ARGUMENT>
            <P>THE Author of the <HI>Reflections on Peace</HI> begins with the following bold a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ertion: <Q>The whole power of the French Revolution con<g ref="char:s">s</g>i<g ref="char:s">s</g>ts in the art of exciting popular enthu<g ref="char:s">s</g>ia<g ref="char:s">s</g>m, and directing it to political pur|po<g ref="char:s">s</g>es.</Q> Page 1, line 1.</P>
            <P>This (though a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>umed, and afterwards relied on as a fundamental propo<g ref="char:s">s</g>ition) I mu<g ref="char:s">s</g>t deny without any he<g ref="char:s">s</g>itation. In the commencement of the Revo|lution it might be true, but has long <g ref="char:s">s</g>ince cea<g ref="char:s">s</g>ed to be <g ref="char:s">s</g>o: for, admitting that popular enthu<g ref="char:s">s</g>ia<g ref="char:s">s</g>m, with liberty for its object, was the in<g ref="char:s">s</g>trument employed to overturn the French Monarchy, and to repel the attempts of the Combined Powers to re<g ref="char:s">s</g>tore it; yet the republican <g ref="char:s">s</g>y<g ref="char:s">s</g>tem which <g ref="char:s">s</g>ucceeded it, could neither have been founded nor <g ref="char:s">s</g>upported <g ref="char:s">s</g>o long, but by a cau<g ref="char:s">s</g>e more <g ref="char:s">s</g>imple, more durable, and more unremittingly active:—I mean <g ref="char:s">s</g>elf-intere<g ref="char:s">s</g>t, which has been <g ref="char:s">s</g>timulated by the invention of a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats. In them, and in them only, con<g ref="char:s">s</g>i<g ref="char:s">s</g>ts at pre<g ref="char:s">s</g>ent <HI>all the power of the French Revolution.</HI> It is by them that it has <g ref="char:s">s</g>ucceeded in bribing every per<g ref="char:s">s</g>onal con|<g ref="char:s">s</g>ideration. By <g ref="char:s">s</g>tipends to civil officers, who are

every one preachers of the new-fa<g ref="char:s">s</g>hioned doctrines, it has <g ref="char:s">s</g>ucceeded in <g ref="char:s">s</g>preading them to every corner of France. Even its foreign conque<g ref="char:s">s</g>ts are merely to be attributed to the a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats, which have hitherto pro|vided for 1,200,000 <g ref="char:s">s</g>oldiers; and no doubt <g ref="char:s">s</g>o extraordinary a number mu<g ref="char:s">s</g>t nece<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>arily have pro|duced extraordinary effects. If the conque<g ref="char:s">s</g>ts of the French Republic have been three times as exten<g ref="char:s">s</g>ive as tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e of Louis XIV. it is becau<g ref="char:s">s</g>e the a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats have enabled it to maintain armies three times as numerous.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="FOOT"><P><HI>Of the truth of this we have the following confirmations in the Convention, by Cambon, Feb. 8, 1795.</HI></P><P>The nation is under great obligations to the Con<g ref="char:s">s</g>tituent A<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>embly for the creation of a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats.

            <P>So long as the a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats were i<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ued in any <g ref="char:s">s</g>ort of proportion to the confi<g ref="char:s">s</g>cations which were pledged for them, they had a real value, and the project was greatly <g ref="char:s">s</g>ucce<g ref="char:s">s</g>sful.

and by means <g ref="char:s">s</g>o immen<g ref="char:s">s</g>e, began to employ it<g ref="char:s">s</g>elf in contriving pretences for new wars, in order to bring them into action; when it began to work this rich mine, as if ab<g ref="char:s">s</g>olutely inexhau<g ref="char:s">s</g>tible; every intel|ligent ob<g ref="char:s">s</g>erver fore<g ref="char:s">s</g>aw the rapid and complete de|preciation of its produce. The calculation that no|thing could prolong the exi<g ref="char:s">s</g>tence of a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats beyond two or three years, has indeed proved erroneous; but it has proved <g ref="char:s">s</g>o, merely becau<g ref="char:s">s</g>e it was impo<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>i|ble to conjecture that <g ref="char:s">s</g>uch extraordinary means would be adopted for <g ref="char:s">s</g>upporting them; and that Robe<g ref="char:s">s</g>|pierre would come forward to prop them up, when tottering, by his two additional projects of <g ref="char:s">s</g>poliation and terror.</P>
            <P>His proce<g ref="char:s">s</g>s is well known. He began by a de|cree, which <g ref="char:s">s</g>eized all the <g ref="char:s">s</g>pecie that could be found, of every <g ref="char:s">s</g>ort, and paid for it with a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats.

Immediately the hu<g ref="char:s">s</g>bandmen and manufacturers left their u<g ref="char:s">s</g>ual occupations, which made them u<g ref="char:s">s</g>eful citizens, to become members of Revolutionary Committees, where they had nothing to do, and by which they enjoyed a <g ref="char:s">s</g>ort of au|thority, and received five livres a day.</HI></P></NOTE> to compel the people to <g ref="char:s">s</g>ub|mit to them, he met the difficulties re<g ref="char:s">s</g>ulting from this multiplication of expence, by contriving a new <g ref="char:s">s</g>ecurity for new emi<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ions of a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats.</P>
            <P>For this purpo<g ref="char:s">s</g>e the <g ref="char:s">s</g>y<g ref="char:s">s</g>tem of terror was adopted in its fulle<g ref="char:s">s</g>t extent, merely as a mea<g ref="char:s">s</g>ure of finance, in which view Robe<g ref="char:s">s</g>pierre undoubtedly con<g ref="char:s">s</g>idered it; and <g ref="char:s">s</g>uch was the <g ref="char:s">s</g>ucce<g ref="char:s">s</g>s of his horrible pro<g ref="char:s">s</g>criptions,

that in <g ref="char:s">s</g>ome in<g ref="char:s">s</g>tances the very <g ref="char:s">s</g>ame e<g ref="char:s">s</g>tates have actually been three times confi<g ref="char:s">s</g>cated and <g ref="char:s">s</g>old again.

            <P>In this way, as <g ref="char:s">s</g>oon as the inferior and <g ref="char:s">s</g>ubaltern robbers of their country were grown rich enough to be worth plundering, the Guillotine transferred their wealth to the State, and furni<g ref="char:s">s</g>hed the <g ref="char:s">s</g>ecurity wanted for new emi<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ions of a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats: this <g ref="char:s">s</g>anguinary con|trivance had the de<g ref="char:s">s</g>ired effect on the infatuated mul|titude, who imagined that their value would not alter, at lea<g ref="char:s">s</g>t in the interior of the Republic, as long as they could find any demagogues to load with riches one day, and to plunder on the next. It was by this terrible round of confi<g ref="char:s">s</g>cations, dilapidations of pub|lic wealth, executions, and emi<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ions of new paper, that the credit of the a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats was <g ref="char:s">s</g>upported for more than a year, and the Republic was actually enabled to provi<g ref="char:s">s</g>ion her fourteen armies at a cheaper rate, though with paper money, than the Allies could their forces with <g ref="char:s">s</g>pecie. To produce this political miracle, co<g ref="char:s">s</g>t Robe<g ref="char:s">s</g>pierre nothing more than a decla|ration that half the property of France was to change its owners by violent means.</P>

They ob<g ref="char:s">s</g>tinately per|<g ref="char:s">s</g>i<g ref="char:s">s</g>ted in carrying on the war, though they were no longer able to fix the currency, or to keep up the value of the a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats, which they were obliged to i<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ue for its expence.</P>
            <P>From that time their relative value has fallen, and mu<g ref="char:s">s</g>t continue to fall in the compound ratio of the depreciation of the exi<g ref="char:s">s</g>ting ma<g ref="char:s">s</g>s (already much greater than can be brought into circulation), and of its continual augmentation.

A <g ref="char:s">s</g>trange de|falcation, e<g ref="char:s">s</g>pecially when we recollect that it was while the <g ref="char:s">s</g>y<g ref="char:s">s</g>tem of terror was in its full force!</P>
            <P>A <g ref="char:s">s</g>econd project was a lottery of four milliards (about 165 millions <g ref="char:s">s</g>terling), which was to induce the holders of a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats to bring them into the public trea<g ref="char:s">s</g>ury, on receiving in<g ref="char:s">s</g>tead of them, in the <g ref="char:s">s</g>hape of prizes, effects which the Republic found it<g ref="char:s">s</g>elf unable to <g ref="char:s">s</g>ell in any other way. But then, <g ref="char:s">s</g>aid Cambon, <HI>we mu<g ref="char:s">s</g>t offer <g ref="char:s">s</g>ome premium</HI>—and he calculated that by allowing 10 per cent. it would co<g ref="char:s">s</g>t the nation 390 millions, and an annual intere<g ref="char:s">s</g>t of 131 millions.— A curious way of relieving the finances! Be<g ref="char:s">s</g>ides, whether as a lottery or as a tontine, the project is impo<g ref="char:s">s</g>|<g ref="char:s">s</g>ible; for either the purcha<g ref="char:s">s</g>e of tickets mu<g ref="char:s">s</g>t be vo|luntary, in which ca<g ref="char:s">s</g>e a <g ref="char:s">s</g>ecurity would be expected for their value, that does not exi<g ref="char:s">s</g>t; or el<g ref="char:s">s</g>e this re<g ref="char:s">s</g>ump|tion of a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats mu<g ref="char:s">s</g>t be effected by force, and, far from improving the credit of any new emi<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ions, would only be evidence of their fate.</P>
            <P>The third of Cambon's projects was <HI>a forced reduc|tion of the nominal value of a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats</HI>—But, <g ref="char:s">s</g>aid he, very candidly, if we arbitrarily reduce the value of tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e already in exi<g ref="char:s">s</g>tence, what credit will the new emi<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ions have? We <g ref="char:s">s</g>hould find it <HI>ab<g ref="char:s">s</g>olutely impo<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ible to carry on the war.</HI></P>
            <P>Force, however, is by no means nece<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ary to bring about this reduction of value. The <HI>bankruptcy</HI> is

            <P>But as to Cambon's ob<g ref="char:s">s</g>ervation, that in this ca<g ref="char:s">s</g>e the Republic will find it <HI>impo<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ible to carry on the war</HI>— <g ref="char:s">s</g>ome per<g ref="char:s">s</g>ons imagine perhaps, that as the Convention mu<g ref="char:s">s</g>t long <g ref="char:s">s</g>ince have fore<g ref="char:s">s</g>een the total depreciation of its paper-money, it mu<g ref="char:s">s</g>t of cour<g ref="char:s">s</g>e have made a pro|vi<g ref="char:s">s</g>ion for that event, out of the immen<g ref="char:s">s</g>e quantity of of trea<g ref="char:s">s</g>ure which it procured by the pillage of the churches.

            <P>But to anticipate at once any <g ref="char:s">s</g>peculations on the means which the French may be <g ref="char:s">s</g>uppo<g ref="char:s">s</g>ed to adopt for protracting the war—let us imagine, that by a <g ref="char:s">s</g>tretch of authority the Convention actually reduces the nominal value of the a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats, or that the people, by general con<g ref="char:s">s</g>ent, agree to give up half or three-fourths of tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e in their hands, to retrieve the value of the remainder.

The capital which the war has hitherto diverted out of its channel, is not that which is u<g ref="char:s">s</g>ually employed in increa<g ref="char:s">s</g>ing the wealth of a country, by facili|tating the means of reproduction; but it is principally that which is u<g ref="char:s">s</g>ually <g ref="char:s">s</g>pent in increa<g ref="char:s">s</g>ing the comforts, and adding to the elegancies of life.</P><P>But to return to the que<g ref="char:s">s</g>tion, from which I perhaps appear to have been wandering: there are two other ways of determining whether the Engli<g ref="char:s">s</g>h nation, taken at large, is more or le<g ref="char:s">s</g>s taxed than others.</P><P>The fir<g ref="char:s">s</g>t is, to compare the annual revenues of the inhabitants, with the <g ref="char:s">s</g>um which they pay to the State. Now, many political calculators e<g ref="char:s">s</g>timate the annual reproduction of Great-Britain (meaning the whole income derived from lands, indu<g ref="char:s">s</g>try, and money) at nearly double the amount of that of France, in her days of pro<g ref="char:s">s</g>perity; and they <g ref="char:s">s</g>upport this e<g ref="char:s">s</g>timate by the circum<g ref="char:s">s</g>tance that Great-Britain, after having <g ref="char:s">s</g>upplied its own con<g ref="char:s">s</g>umption, exported a <g ref="char:s">s</g>urplus produce twice as great as that of France, which amounted only to about twelve millions <g ref="char:s">s</g>terling; whereas the ex|<GAP DESC="ILLEGIBLE" RESP="PDCC" EXTENT="1 letter"/>orts of Great-Britain amounted, in 1792, to twenty-five millions <g ref="char:s">s</g>terling. But let us even <g ref="char:s">s</g>uppo<g ref="char:s">s</g>e the incomes of the two nations only equal; then, as the public revenue of France, before the re|volution, amounted to about twenty-four millions <g ref="char:s">s</g>terling, and that of Great-Britain, before the war, to about <g ref="char:s">s</g>ixteen millions, it is clear that the former, even admitting the incomes of the two king|doms to be equal, paid 124/100 while the latter paid no more than 16/100.

Struck, no doubt, with the eloquence with which Mr. Fox has de<g ref="char:s">s</g>cribed the aby<g ref="char:s">s</g>s into which the ob<g ref="char:s">s</g>tinacy of Admini<g ref="char:s">s</g>tration is plunging this country, by prolonging <g ref="char:s">s</g>o hopele<g ref="char:s">s</g>s a war—the Author of <HI>Reflections on Peace</HI> brings him forward to corroborate <HI>the evidence of the dangers</HI> of every kind, internal as well as external, from which nothing but a peace can pre<g ref="char:s">s</g>erve Great-Britain.</P>
            <P>So much re<g ref="char:s">s</g>pect is due to the authority of Mr. Fox, that I would readily let the opinion of the fide|lity of my <g ref="char:s">s</g>tatement of the re<g ref="char:s">s</g>ources of Great-Bri|tain re<g ref="char:s">s</g>t on his te<g ref="char:s">s</g>timony.

            <ARGUMENT>
              <P>In<g ref="char:s">s</g>urmountable Ob<g ref="char:s">s</g>tacles prevent France from remaining a Republic. It is of the utmo<g ref="char:s">s</g>t importance to her to avoid an elective Chief; and to return to a Monarchy, hereditary, but limited.</P>
            </ARGUMENT>
            <P>WILL the Republic, one, indivi<g ref="char:s">s</g>ible, and demo|cratic, be e<g ref="char:s">s</g>tabli<g ref="char:s">s</g>hed in France? Will that great political body divide it<g ref="char:s">s</g>elf into Cantons, confederated like Swi<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>erland? Will it adopt an elective Chief like the United States of America? Will not the French go back to their Con<g ref="char:s">s</g>titution of 1791? Will they not, when weary of change, <g ref="char:s">s</g>eek a refuge in their for|mer de<g ref="char:s">s</g>poti<g ref="char:s">s</g>m? Will they not imitate the hereditary and limited Monarchy of Great-Britain?</P>
            <P>The fir<g ref="char:s">s</g>t of the<g ref="char:s">s</g>e que<g ref="char:s">s</g>tions is the only one on which I think we may, as yet, give a decided judgment; and if, with re<g ref="char:s">s</g>pect to that, I venture an opinion, after <g ref="char:s">s</g>o many <g ref="char:s">s</g>peculations have failed, it is becau<g ref="char:s">s</g>e I am con|vinced that the third year of the French Republic has furni<g ref="char:s">s</g>hed <HI>data</HI> from which we can almo<g ref="char:s">s</g>t with cer|tainty affirm that the curtain will <g ref="char:s">s</g>oon drop before this Republican Drama.</P>
            <P>Let it not be <g ref="char:s">s</g>aid that their language is as repub|lican as ever; for, as to the French nation, what <g ref="char:s">s</g>igni|fies the opinion of to-day, compared with the events which may change it to-morrow? Be<g ref="char:s">s</g>ides, I am very much deceived, if by this time there are not, even at

Paris, many more royali<g ref="char:s">s</g>ts, concealed under the di<g ref="char:s">s</g>gui<g ref="char:s">s</g>e of republicans, than there were republicans four years ago under the di<g ref="char:s">s</g>gui<g ref="char:s">s</g>e of royali<g ref="char:s">s</g>ts. I have for <g ref="char:s">s</g>ome time <g ref="char:s">s</g>u<g ref="char:s">s</g>pected that even the pre<g ref="char:s">s</g>ent le<GAP DESC="ILLEGIBLE" RESP="PDCC" EXTENT="1 letter"/>ders of the Convention are not <g ref="char:s">s</g>o republican as they pre|tend; for if they were, they <g ref="char:s">s</g>urely would not dream of extending the territory of France, already, beyond a doubt, <g ref="char:s">s</g>o large as to be an in<g ref="char:s">s</g>urmountable difficulty in the way of their <g ref="char:s">s</g>y<g ref="char:s">s</g>tem.</P>
            <P>If tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e leaders were ever <g ref="char:s">s</g>incerely attached to that <g ref="char:s">s</g>y<g ref="char:s">s</g>tem, it could only be in the commencement of their revolutionary career; for the mi<g ref="char:s">s</g>ery, the fears, and the per<g ref="char:s">s</g>onal dangers which tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e who <g ref="char:s">s</g>urvive of the Girondi<g ref="char:s">s</g>t faction have undergone, mu<g ref="char:s">s</g>t have opened their eyes long before the public di<g ref="char:s">s</g>tre<g ref="char:s">s</g>s was great enough to open the eyes of the multitude. I would a<g ref="char:s">s</g>k tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e Frenchmen of character and principle, who became Democrats only from exaggerated notions of human virtue,—do they <g ref="char:s">s</g>till believe that the virtues and the talents which <g ref="char:s">s</g>ecure admiration and deference in private life, will be equally preeminent and com|manding in a crowd? I would refer this que<g ref="char:s">s</g>tion to the con<g ref="char:s">s</g>cience of that member of the Convention who, about three months ago, once more <g ref="char:s">s</g>olicited his col|leagues to ha<g ref="char:s">s</g>ten the <HI>magnificent enterpri<g ref="char:s">s</g>e of forming a Democracy of twenty-four millions of men;</HI> or rather, I would decide it by that <g ref="char:s">s</g>ame member's eloquent de<g ref="char:s">s</g>criptions in his di<g ref="char:s">s</g>cour<g ref="char:s">s</g>e <HI>on terror.</HI> Every page of the hi<g ref="char:s">s</g>tory of every great Republic, will decide it; for there virtue is <g ref="char:s">s</g>een <g ref="char:s">s</g>uffering and <g ref="char:s">s</g>ilenced, while the <g ref="char:s">s</g>elfi<g ref="char:s">s</g>h pa<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ions only di<g ref="char:s">s</g>play them<g ref="char:s">s</g>elves, and tri|umph.</P>
            <P>One truth by this time the French ought to have learned in their <g ref="char:s">s</g>chool of adver<g ref="char:s">s</g>ity—that they have, in no re<g ref="char:s">s</g>pect whatever, the moral character which is in|di<g ref="char:s">s</g>pen<g ref="char:s">s</g>able for a popular government. To be fit for it, a nation mu<g ref="char:s">s</g>t have education and moral habits unknown in France, and which can only be acquired

by a long u<g ref="char:s">s</g>e of liberty; and in <g ref="char:s">s</g>ome degree even by its abu<g ref="char:s">s</g>es. A republican ought to have that <g ref="char:s">s</g>ort of di<g ref="char:s">s</g>cernment which can di<g ref="char:s">s</g>tingui<g ref="char:s">s</g>h between faction and patrioti<g ref="char:s">s</g>m; between tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e who would agitate the people, and tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e who would protect them: he ought to have mode<g ref="char:s">s</g>ty enough to reverence the experience of age, and to give place on all occa<g ref="char:s">s</g>ions to <g ref="char:s">s</g>uperior talents. A republican government requires the <g ref="char:s">s</g>tricte<g ref="char:s">s</g>t and mo<g ref="char:s">s</g>t con<g ref="char:s">s</g>tant ob<g ref="char:s">s</g>ervation of <g ref="char:s">s</g>ocial duties; it requires that parental and conjugal authority, that every dome<g ref="char:s">s</g>tic virtue, <g ref="char:s">s</g>hould come in aid of public force; it requires the moderated warmth which animates debate, and the wi<g ref="char:s">s</g>e circum<g ref="char:s">s</g>pection which re<g ref="char:s">s</g>trains it within due limits. A Republic, to <g ref="char:s">s</g>upport it<g ref="char:s">s</g>elf, mu<g ref="char:s">s</g>t con<g ref="char:s">s</g>i<g ref="char:s">s</g>t of a people which knows where to <g ref="char:s">s</g>top, when party degenerates into faction;—of a people au<g ref="char:s">s</g>tere in manners, grave in character, not ha<g ref="char:s">s</g>ty in giving its confidence, or changing its opinions; a people which has either the phlegm of the Dutch, the tardine<g ref="char:s">s</g>s of the Swi<g ref="char:s">s</g>s, the <g ref="char:s">s</g>agacity of Genoa, the prudence of Venice, or the information which Ame|rica has derived from the Engli<g ref="char:s">s</g>h <g ref="char:s">s</g>chool of Liberty. If ever the French <g ref="char:s">s</g>hould attain to <g ref="char:s">s</g>o many qualities foreign to their nature, it will be a mo<g ref="char:s">s</g>t extraordinary metamorpho<g ref="char:s">s</g>is; one which nothing can ever effect but the gradual operation of a free Monarchy. Let them however once enter that port, and I am convinced they will not leave it again, but to return in a very <g ref="char:s">s</g>hort time, as the Engli<g ref="char:s">s</g>h did, and moor in it for ever.</P>

              <Q>In this glorious effort the Poles had but one avowed ally; and, will it be credited? that ally was France!

            <ARGUMENT>
              <P>Of <g ref="char:s">s</g>ome Prejudices of the French re<g ref="char:s">s</g>pecting the Briti<g ref="char:s">s</g>h Con<g ref="char:s">s</g>titution.</P>
            </ARGUMENT>
            <P>AMONG the great number of well-informed men in France, before the pre<g ref="char:s">s</g>ent Revolution, nothing was more uncommon than to find any who had tolerably correct ideas of the Briti<g ref="char:s">s</g>h Con<g ref="char:s">s</g>titution; and it mu<g ref="char:s">s</g>t be owned that in general the Engli<g ref="char:s">s</g>h who travelled there took no great pains to inform them on the <g ref="char:s">s</g>ub|ject. Whether it is that the Engli<g ref="char:s">s</g>h are too much inclined to believe that few foreigners can compre|hend the principles of <g ref="char:s">s</g>o complicated <g ref="char:s">s</g>y<g ref="char:s">s</g>tem; or that, with a view to complete the contra<g ref="char:s">s</g>t between the character of the two nations, the Engli<g ref="char:s">s</g>h <g ref="char:s">s</g>tudiou<g ref="char:s">s</g>ly affect to be indifferent to the opinion of foreigners; or that, from a principle of humanity, they are unwil|ling, when abroad, to remind other nations of their want of liberty; and on that account are afraid of ex|pre<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ing too <g ref="char:s">s</g>trongly the conviction which is inter|woven in every thought, and manife<g ref="char:s">s</g>ted in every action of an Engli<g ref="char:s">s</g>hman, <HI>that he, and he only, is free.</HI></P>
            <P>Till Mr. De Lolme publi<g ref="char:s">s</g>hed his work, tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e of the French who had any opinion at all on the <g ref="char:s">s</g>ubject, were almo<g ref="char:s">s</g>t all extravagant in prai<g ref="char:s">s</g>ing the Briti<g ref="char:s">s</g>h Con|<g ref="char:s">s</g>titution, or equally extravagant in condemning it.</P>
            <P>The former con<g ref="char:s">s</g>idered it as a <g ref="char:s">s</g>y<g ref="char:s">s</g>tem truly divine, unconnected with any human pa<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ions, the perfection of political virtue; while, on the contrary, it goes <g ref="char:s">s</g>o

entirely upon a con<g ref="char:s">s</g>ciou<g ref="char:s">s</g>ne<g ref="char:s">s</g>s of human imperfection, that it may very properly be called a complete <g ref="char:s">s</g>y<g ref="char:s">s</g>tem of <HI>human correction.</HI> It does not proceed upon the impo<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ible <g ref="char:s">s</g>peculation of eradicating the pa<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ions, or governing without them; but its arrangements are adapted to limit their career, to direct them to the bene|fit of <g ref="char:s">s</g>ocial life, and even to govern by their a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>i<g ref="char:s">s</g>tance.</P>
            <P>Next came the cen<g ref="char:s">s</g>urers, who formed their judg|ments, partly from writers as ignorant as them<g ref="char:s">s</g>elves; and partly from the parliamentary debates, in which they under<g ref="char:s">s</g>tood every hyperbolical, metaphorical, or declamatory expre<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ion, in a literal <g ref="char:s">s</g>en<g ref="char:s">s</g>e.</P>
            <P>Fir<g ref="char:s">s</g>t they gravely told you <HI>that the King is always carrying on a <g ref="char:s">s</g>ecret war again<g ref="char:s">s</g>t the Con<g ref="char:s">s</g>titution;</HI> which has very little other meaning than that the Con<g ref="char:s">s</g>titu|tion has provided effectually again<g ref="char:s">s</g>t open ho<g ref="char:s">s</g>tilities.</P>
            <P>Next they told you <HI>that the Hou<g ref="char:s">s</g>e of Peers is evi|dently a <g ref="char:s">s</g>ort of advanced po<g ref="char:s">s</g>t to the Crown, where the Nobles act the part of <g ref="char:s">s</g>entinels ana <g ref="char:s">s</g>pies;—that the Peerage is evidently a <g ref="char:s">s</g>atellite of the Crown, and only <g ref="char:s">s</g>erves to <g ref="char:s">s</g>trengthen it again<g ref="char:s">s</g>t the nation.</HI> Now, no one di<g ref="char:s">s</g>putes but that the Peers are intended to guard the Crown, and that their <g ref="char:s">s</g>ituation does make them a <g ref="char:s">s</g>ort of advanced po<g ref="char:s">s</g>t for its protection; but that po<g ref="char:s">s</g>t is defen<g ref="char:s">s</g>ive only: they have no privileges which give them the <g ref="char:s">s</g>malle<g ref="char:s">s</g>t power of attacking the con<g ref="char:s">s</g>titu|tional rights of the Commons; and their political in|fluence, as a body, depends as much on preventing the de<g ref="char:s">s</g>poti<g ref="char:s">s</g>m, as on maintaining the prerogatives of the Crown.</P>
            <P><HI>No matter,</HI> <g ref="char:s">s</g>ay the French of the pre<g ref="char:s">s</g>ent day; <HI>an hereditary Nobility is nothing but a great impo<g ref="char:s">s</g>ition upon <g ref="char:s">s</g>ociety; it is an infringement of tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e equal rights which all men derive from nature.</HI> But admitting it is <g ref="char:s">s</g>o, does it not prevent many other greater, and more dange|rous infringements?

Can we conceive a <g ref="char:s">s</g>ociety which can prevent the Ari<g ref="char:s">s</g>tocracy of riches? and does not this latter even increa<g ref="char:s">s</g>e in proportion as a State is well governed? Is it le<g ref="char:s">s</g>s greedy, or more enlightened, than an hereditary Nobility? Is not this latter <g ref="char:s">s</g>pecies of Ari<g ref="char:s">s</g>tocracy the be<g ref="char:s">s</g>t, indeed the only counterpoi<g ref="char:s">s</g>e, in a great State, to the former? Is the arrogance of up<g ref="char:s">s</g>tarts le<g ref="char:s">s</g>s grating to the people, from among whom they came, or is their familiar in<g ref="char:s">s</g>olence le<g ref="char:s">s</g>s in<g ref="char:s">s</g>ulting, than the haughty di<g ref="char:s">s</g>tance of an here|ditary Nobility?</P>
            <P>Certainly there is in the Briti<g ref="char:s">s</g>h Con<g ref="char:s">s</g>titution, a No|bility, or rather an hereditary Peerage; I will add too, that the <g ref="char:s">s</g>ingle privilege which it po<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>e<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>es, is by its nature much <g ref="char:s">s</g>uperior to the whole multitude of petty privileges belonging to the nobles of all other countries in Europe: and let the French mention, if they can, any of the privileges of the Briti<g ref="char:s">s</g>h Peerage which are burden<g ref="char:s">s</g>ome to the people, or in any way in|jurious to it.</P>
            <P>The French are much mi<g ref="char:s">s</g>taken, if they think that in this country wealth is enough to procure nobility; or that, if wealth could purcha<g ref="char:s">s</g>e it, it would give that exemption from taxes which is the ordinary con<g ref="char:s">s</g>e|quence of it in mo<g ref="char:s">s</g>t other countries. The Briti<g ref="char:s">s</g>h Peerage can hardly be <g ref="char:s">s</g>aid to po<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>e<g ref="char:s">s</g>s more than one exclu<g ref="char:s">s</g>ive privilege,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="FOOT"><P>As members of one of the Hou<g ref="char:s">s</g>es of Parliament, Peers are exempt from arre<g ref="char:s">s</g>t for debt; but their property may be <g ref="char:s">s</g>eized for the u<g ref="char:s">s</g>e of their creditors, without any di<g ref="char:s">s</g>tinction even of the Princes of the Blood.</P><P>And though the Peers have the privilege of being tried by their own body for criminal offences, yet their puni<g ref="char:s">s</g>hment, if convicted, is the <g ref="char:s">s</g>ame as that of a commoner.

one, and that is, the hereditary right of <g ref="char:s">s</g>ucceeding to a <g ref="char:s">s</g>eat in the Hou<g ref="char:s">s</g>e of Lords. I acknowledge that this is a privilege of great importance: but before it is cen<g ref="char:s">s</g>ured as improper, it may be worth con<g ref="char:s">s</g>idering whether that hereditary <g ref="char:s">s</g>ucce<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ion has not a <g ref="char:s">s</g>trong tendency to defend the fundamental principles of the Con<g ref="char:s">s</g>titution, as well as to pre<g ref="char:s">s</g>erve certain great maxims of State, which might el<g ref="char:s">s</g>e be in danger, in ca<g ref="char:s">s</g>e of the coincidence of a general election, with any violent popular agitation. No one can be ignorant of the effect which popular agitation mu<g ref="char:s">s</g>t always have, in a greater or le<g ref="char:s">s</g>s degree, on an a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>embly elected by the people.

            <P>It <g ref="char:s">s</g>hould be recollected that the Briti<g ref="char:s">s</g>h Peers are by no means numerous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="FOOT"><P>The Hou<g ref="char:s">s</g>e of Lords con<g ref="char:s">s</g>i<g ref="char:s">s</g>ts at pre<g ref="char:s">s</g>ent of 274 members, inclu|ding the Bi<g ref="char:s">s</g>hops and the <g ref="char:s">s</g>ixteen Scotch Peers.

All I de<g ref="char:s">s</g>ire is, to be able to correct <g ref="char:s">s</g>ome of the prevailing errors among them on this <g ref="char:s">s</g>ubject, and to induce them to believe it worth a fuller examination, and to read the publications which develope the elements of it. The mo<g ref="char:s">s</g>t complete work on this <g ref="char:s">s</g>ubject is certainly that of Mr. De Lolme; none more clearly explains its principles, or is more explicit, on the manner in which its different branches are a check upon one another, and on the <g ref="char:s">s</g>ecurity it gives to per<g ref="char:s">s</g>onal liberty.</P>

            <P>It is a circum<g ref="char:s">s</g>tance worthy remarking, that the two fir<g ref="char:s">s</g>t writers who attempted to recommend the Briti<g ref="char:s">s</g>h Con<g ref="char:s">s</g>titution to the French, were rival Mini<g ref="char:s">s</g>ters of Finance. Oppo<g ref="char:s">s</g>ite and ho<g ref="char:s">s</g>tile on every other <g ref="char:s">s</g>ub|ject; in this, and in this only, they agree, that the Briti<g ref="char:s">s</g>h Con<g ref="char:s">s</g>titution, which both have <g ref="char:s">s</g>tudied, and both admire, may by <g ref="char:s">s</g>ome modifications be gradu|ally introduced into France.</P>
            <P>Perhaps the mo<g ref="char:s">s</g>t unfortunate <g ref="char:s">s</g>tep of the Con<g ref="char:s">s</g>ti|tuent A<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>embly, is one for which it has been very little cen<g ref="char:s">s</g>ured; I mean, its having voted the Mo|narchy, exactly as the Convention has <g ref="char:s">s</g>ince voted the Republic,—by acclamation. If that A<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>embly had but calmly and gravely debated the important que<g ref="char:s">s</g>tion of limited Monarchy; <g ref="char:s">s</g>uch a di<g ref="char:s">s</g>cu<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ion, if carried to a <g ref="char:s">s</g>ufficient extent, and clo<g ref="char:s">s</g>ely inve<g ref="char:s">s</g>tigated, might have <g ref="char:s">s</g>hewn the French a great number of valuable political truths, which they were at that time <g ref="char:s">s</g>till capable of attending to, and which might then have made a deep and la<g ref="char:s">s</g>ting impre<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ion.

          <HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
          <P>PEACE is the univer<g ref="char:s">s</g>al and earne<g ref="char:s">s</g>t prayer of all the Powers at war with France. Why will not the French then at la<g ref="char:s">s</g>t <g ref="char:s">s</g>ee the aby<g ref="char:s">s</g>s into which the ob|<g ref="char:s">s</g>tinacy of the pre<g ref="char:s">s</g>ent Convention is precipitating them? Can it be po<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ible that they <g ref="char:s">s</g>till deceive them|<g ref="char:s">s</g>elves? Do they <g ref="char:s">s</g>till imagine that a government can be renovated amid the din of arms, and the dangers of war? or that famine at home can be pre|vented, by employing the <g ref="char:s">s</g>trength of their country in maintaining a precarious po<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>e<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ion of de<g ref="char:s">s</g>olated con|que<g ref="char:s">s</g>ts?</P>
          <P>What can they hope to gain by prolonging this bloody conte<g ref="char:s">s</g>t? Is it glory? They have already borne down all oppo<g ref="char:s">s</g>ition. Do they wi<g ref="char:s">s</g>h for more conque<g ref="char:s">s</g>ts? Tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e they have already made have in|jured them more than a diminution of territory would have done. What then prevents them? Fal<g ref="char:s">s</g>e <g ref="char:s">s</g>hame. They will not <g ref="char:s">s</g>ubmit to the humiliation of re<g ref="char:s">s</g>titution. But which is lea<g ref="char:s">s</g>t humiliating—a retreat from choice, or a retreat from evident nece<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ity? What humilia|tion can there be in re<g ref="char:s">s</g>toring what they have taken, to enemies whom they have vanqui<g ref="char:s">s</g>hed? And as to Great-Britain, can they doubt a moment but that <g ref="char:s">s</g>uch an unequivocal proof of their pacific di<g ref="char:s">s</g>po<g ref="char:s">s</g>ition would produce a <g ref="char:s">s</g>imilar di<g ref="char:s">s</g>po<g ref="char:s">s</g>ition in her? Do they fear that the Princes at war with them will take advantage of <g ref="char:s">s</g>uch re<g ref="char:s">s</g>titutions, to renew the conte<g ref="char:s">s</g>t on the fron|tier?

            <P>Every debate of the Convention on this <g ref="char:s">s</g>ubject proves, that, far from having been betrayed into any exaggeration, I was even more moderate than was nece<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ary, in the greater part of the inductions which I made in the Second Chapter, relative to the pro|gre<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ively-increa<g ref="char:s">s</g>ing emi<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ions, the rapid depreciation, and the probable annihilation of the a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats.</P>
            <P>With an intention of avoiding any <g ref="char:s">s</g>ort of exag|geration, I only a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>umed that the remaining expence of the pre<g ref="char:s">s</g>ent year, might require an emi<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ion of a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ig|nats in the proportion of the month of Nivo<g ref="char:s">s</g>e, and that <g ref="char:s">s</g>uch an emi<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ion would add about five milliards to the ma<g ref="char:s">s</g>s. But it now appears that the deficiency of the two months of Pluvio<g ref="char:s">s</g>e and Germinal was

            <P>So that a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats to the amount of very nearly forty-four millions <g ref="char:s">s</g>terling mu<g ref="char:s">s</g>t have been i<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ued, to di<g ref="char:s">s</g>|charge

the expences of tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e two months only. From every appearance, we have rea<g ref="char:s">s</g>on to think, that the month of Floreal, which ended on the 20th of May, mu<g ref="char:s">s</g>t have required an emi<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ion of a milliard. So that, in<g ref="char:s">s</g>tead of withdrawing four milliards of the old a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats from circulation (a mea<g ref="char:s">s</g>ure which, la<g ref="char:s">s</g>t December, the Convention allowed to be indi<g ref="char:s">s</g>pen|<g ref="char:s">s</g>able), it will have added, between that time and the 20th of May, about three milliards to the <g ref="char:s">s</g>even or eight which were then in circulation. And, as to the progre<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ive lo<g ref="char:s">s</g>s of their remaining value, I <g ref="char:s">s</g>aid (page the 28th) that, <HI>if they continue to fall at the rate of</HI> 5 <HI>per cent. every two months, in a very <g ref="char:s">s</g>hort time they will not be worth circulating.</HI> But as, during a Revolution, circum<g ref="char:s">s</g>tances may happen to defeat the mo<g ref="char:s">s</g>t plau<g ref="char:s">s</g>ible conjectures, I allowed that this event might be <HI>delayed to the end of the year, or beyond it.</HI> The highe<g ref="char:s">s</g>t calculations however have proved neare<g ref="char:s">s</g>t to the truth; for, from the la<g ref="char:s">s</g>t accounts received from different provinces of France, it appears that, between the end of March and the end of May, the a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats lo<g ref="char:s">s</g>t more than one half of their remaining value.</P>
            <P>If we add to the above-mentioned circum<g ref="char:s">s</g>tances, that tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e who have purcha<g ref="char:s">s</g>ed the confi<g ref="char:s">s</g>cated pro|perty, become daily more in<g ref="char:s">s</g>ecure, and, from what Chenier <g ref="char:s">s</g>aid on the 1<g ref="char:s">s</g>t of May, are already con<g ref="char:s">s</g>idered as <g ref="char:s">s</g>acrilegious; we may, I think, fairly conclude, that the time is not far di<g ref="char:s">s</g>tant, when the Convention will no longer find dupes enough to <g ref="char:s">s</g>peculate in tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e purcha<g ref="char:s">s</g>es, or to take its a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats. The time probably is not far di<g ref="char:s">s</g>tant, when the latter will be treated like <g ref="char:s">s</g>ome of the provincial paper in America, which at la<g ref="char:s">s</g>t was thrown away as u<g ref="char:s">s</g>ele<g ref="char:s">s</g>s, when no one could be found to take it at the thou<g ref="char:s">s</g>andth part of its nominal value.</P>
            <P>In confirmation of what I have already <g ref="char:s">s</g>aid on this <g ref="char:s">s</g>ubject, I <g ref="char:s">s</g>hall cite, verbatim, a part of a <g ref="char:s">s</g>peech made by Dupuis the 7th of April, in the Convention.</P>

In creating a new <g ref="char:s">s</g>pecies of money, our predece<g ref="char:s">s</g>|<g ref="char:s">s</g>ors thought of the means of beginning a Revolution,</HI> BUT DID NOT THINK OF ANY FOR FINISHING IT.</P>
            <P>We are yet to learn what means the Convention will find to <HI>fini<g ref="char:s">s</g>h the Revolution,</HI> and terminate the war with Great-Britain, which, it <g ref="char:s">s</g>ays, was <HI>bequeathed</HI> to it by the preceding A<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>emblies.</P>
            <P>All the per<g ref="char:s">s</g>ons coming from France agree in <g ref="char:s">s</g>aying, that the general opinion again<g ref="char:s">s</g>t the duration of the Republic, <g ref="char:s">s</g>hews it<g ref="char:s">s</g>elf mo<g ref="char:s">s</g>t decidedly in the <g ref="char:s">s</g>ale of the confi<g ref="char:s">s</g>cations.

As to the Crown lands, it is difficult to find purcha<g ref="char:s">s</g>ers for them; and as to the e<g ref="char:s">s</g>tates of the emigrants, <g ref="char:s">s</g>till fewer per<g ref="char:s">s</g>ons will have any thing to do with them: be<g ref="char:s">s</g>ides this, a marked difference is made between property confi<g ref="char:s">s</g>|cated by the Con<g ref="char:s">s</g>tituent, and by the <g ref="char:s">s</g>ucceeding A<g ref="char:s">s</g>|<g ref="char:s">s</g>emblies.</P>
            <P>Such <g ref="char:s">s</g>hades of opinion on this <g ref="char:s">s</g>ubject, can only proceed from a general impre<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ion, that the Conven|tion is at its la<g ref="char:s">s</g>t ga<g ref="char:s">s</g>p, that all it has done will peri<g ref="char:s">s</g>h with it, and the Republic no longer exi<g ref="char:s">s</g>t. To keep out of <g ref="char:s">s</g>ight the <g ref="char:s">s</g>ymptoms of di<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>olution, the Con|vention have formed a <g ref="char:s">s</g>cheme of <g ref="char:s">s</g>elling the hou<g ref="char:s">s</g>es and buildings belonging to the emigrants, by way of lottery, in order to get rid of them at once, and to avoid tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e di<g ref="char:s">s</g>tinctions which the public opinion makes re<g ref="char:s">s</g>pecting them.

            <HEAD>Fall of the Republic.</HEAD>
            <P>The fall of the Republic is as rapid as that of the A<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats; and every incident, <g ref="char:s">s</g>ince the publication of this pamphlet, corroborates the a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ertion in page 35, <HI>that the Republic will peri<g ref="char:s">s</g>h, as the Monarchy peri<g ref="char:s">s</g>hed, by the ruin of its finances.</HI> The myriads who have hither|to <g ref="char:s">s</g>upported this <g ref="char:s">s</g>y<g ref="char:s">s</g>tem from <HI><g ref="char:s">s</g>elf-intere<g ref="char:s">s</g>t,</HI> will <g ref="char:s">s</g>oon find, that there can be no more confi<g ref="char:s">s</g>cations to pil|lage; and that republican <g ref="char:s">s</g>alaries are no very tempt|ing bribe, when paid in republican money.</P>
            <P>The pre<g ref="char:s">s</g>ent <g ref="char:s">s</g>y<g ref="char:s">s</g>tem, unable to give protection to tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e who have property, and unable to gratify the avidity of tho<g ref="char:s">s</g>e who de<g ref="char:s">s</g>ire it, is evidently ha<g ref="char:s">s</g>|tening to a di<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>olution. There is one indication of the prevailing belief at Paris, that Royalty will <g ref="char:s">s</g>oon be re-e<g ref="char:s">s</g>tabli<g ref="char:s">s</g>hed, which appears to me almo<g ref="char:s">s</g>t infal|lible; I mean the marked preference given to <GAP DESC="ILLEGIBLE" RESP="PDCC" EXTENT="1 letter"/>he a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats which were i<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ued during the Monarchy. <HI>La Croix</HI> complained in the Convention, on the 6th of May, that a republican a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignat of 10 <GAP DESC="ILLEGIBLE" RESP="PDCC" EXTENT="1 letter"/>ivres was publicly exchanged for a royal a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignat of 5. This circum<g ref="char:s">s</g>tance, together with the reluctance <g ref="char:s">s</g>hewn by purcha<g ref="char:s">s</g>ers to <g ref="char:s">s</g>peculate in e<g ref="char:s">s</g>tates confi<g ref="char:s">s</g>cated <g ref="char:s">s</g>ince the di<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>olution of the Con<g ref="char:s">s</g>tituent A<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>embly, prove, not only a prevailing expectation of the re-e<g ref="char:s">s</g>tabli<g ref="char:s">s</g>h|ment of Royalty; but more than this, an opinion that every power that has been exerci<g ref="char:s">s</g>ed in the mean time, will be con<g ref="char:s">s</g>idered as u<g ref="char:s">s</g>urpation, and all its acts re<g ref="char:s">s</g>cinded.

            <P>In order to conceal, as much as po<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ible, this evidence of the public opinion, the Convention found it<g ref="char:s">s</g>elf reduced to the nece<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ity of <g ref="char:s">s</g>topping the circu|lation of all the royal a<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ignats: a mea<g ref="char:s">s</g>ure which increa<g ref="char:s">s</g>ed the irritation of the populace, and contri|buted

very con<g ref="char:s">s</g>iderably to the <g ref="char:s">s</g>truggle which took place at Paris, between <GAP DESC="ILLEGIBLE" RESP="PDCC" EXTENT="2 letters"/>e different factions, on the 22d, 23d, and 24th of May. Per<g ref="char:s">s</g>ons who have but <g ref="char:s">s</g>uperficially con<g ref="char:s">s</g>idered the war of factions, and the hi<g ref="char:s">s</g>tory of republics, may po<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ibly imagine that victory implies <g ref="char:s">s</g>trength; and that the exi<g ref="char:s">s</g>ting <g ref="char:s">s</g>y<g ref="char:s">s</g>tem in France is likely to be more durable, from the i<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ue of this formidable attack. But, in fact, this very victory, both from its nece<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ary effect on the defeated party, and from the means by which it was gained, will probably contribute to increa<g ref="char:s">s</g>e the <g ref="char:s">s</g>ilent but rooted aver<g ref="char:s">s</g>ion to the Convention.</P>
            <P>The defeated party are the Jacobins and their in<g ref="char:s">s</g>truments; the leaders without principle, the in|<g ref="char:s">s</g>truments ferocious, de<g ref="char:s">s</g>perate, and irritated to mad|ne<g ref="char:s">s</g>s, by di<g ref="char:s">s</g>appointment and want. The <g ref="char:s">s</g>ame in<g ref="char:s">s</g>tru|ments, and the <g ref="char:s">s</g>ame practices, were re<g ref="char:s">s</g>orted to again<g ref="char:s">s</g>t the Convention as again<g ref="char:s">s</g>t Louis XVI. The Con|querors of the Ba<g ref="char:s">s</g>tille, the Fauxbourgs of St. Mar|ceau and St. Antoine, the men who dragged the late unfortunate King from Ver<g ref="char:s">s</g>ailles, the furious bands of the tenth of Augu<g ref="char:s">s</g>t, the murderers of the <g ref="char:s">s</g>econd of September, the very populace to which the Con|vention owed its exi<g ref="char:s">s</g>tence, were, on this occa<g ref="char:s">s</g>ion, em|ployed to de<g ref="char:s">s</g>troy it. The <g ref="char:s">s</g>ame <g ref="char:s">s</g>y<g ref="char:s">s</g>tem of in<g ref="char:s">s</g>urrec|tion was adopted; the National Gens-d'Armes, the Pretorian Guard of the Convention, were <g ref="char:s">s</g>educed (as the Royal Guards were in the fir<g ref="char:s">s</g>t in<g ref="char:s">s</g>urrection), and joined the con<g ref="char:s">s</g>pirators. However, the victory of the Convention was complete: the Gens-d'Armes were ca<g ref="char:s">s</g>hiered, and the populace of Paris entirely di<g ref="char:s">s</g>|armed.</P>
            <P>The Convention owed its victory to the armed force of Paris, which had lately been e<g ref="char:s">s</g>tabli<g ref="char:s">s</g>hed for the very purpo<g ref="char:s">s</g>e of repre<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ing the Jacobin faction; and to the dread of the ferocious outrages of that faction, which united all parties, often<g ref="char:s">s</g>ibly to <g ref="char:s">s</g>upport the Convention but really for their own pre<g ref="char:s">s</g>ervation.</P>

            <P>This event the Girondi<g ref="char:s">s</g>ts will, no doubt, u<g ref="char:s">s</g>e every endeavour to prevent; and it is not impo<g ref="char:s">s</g><g ref="char:s">s</g>ible but that the Con<g ref="char:s">s</g>titution which they are now framing may be <g ref="char:s">s</g>o far accommodated to pre<g ref="char:s">s</g>ent circum<g ref="char:s">s</g>tances as to po<g ref="char:s">s</g>tpone it: but what probability is there that the third Con<g ref="char:s">s</g>titution will la<g ref="char:s">s</g>t longer than the fir<g ref="char:s">s</g>t or the <g ref="char:s">s</g>econd?
