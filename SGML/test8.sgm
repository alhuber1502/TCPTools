But to procede in that I was now about to saie, truly for the Englysheman to bee offended with the admixtion of Latine, or the Latine manne to myslyke the pouthreyng of Greke, appereth vnto me a muche like thyng, as if at a feaste with varietee of good meates &amp; drynkes furnyshed, one that loueth to feede of a Capon, should take displeasure that an other

But in this behalf though a prince might haue voide tymes enough to peruse y^e infinite multitude of bookes of histories, what manne wer hable to comprehend and kepe theim all freashe in his memorie? But like as those persones who been dooers in y^e game or feacte of wrastleyng haue in a rea|dynesse at all tymes certain suer poinctes and wayes bothe to catche holde, and also to wend out of holde, when neede is, so thei y^t trauaill in the busie occupacions of peace and of warre must of congruence haue in a readynesse suer rewles, by whiche thei maye bee putte in remembreaunce what is in that presente case nedefull or expediente to bee dooen, and what not. And in this behalf, we see y^t diuerse highly well learned me~ne haue assaied &amp; taken peine by their good diligence to ease the carefulnesse of princes and noble menne, emong whiche, some haue writen lesso~s of vertue in brief sente~ces, as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Theognis a Greke poete y^t wryteth in E|legeiacal vses suche morall preceptes of virtue as been in y^e litle trea|tise y^t is reade vnder y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> nam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Cato.</NOTE> The|ognis, and <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="marg">Isocrates a greke oratour wrytyng ma|ny litle trea|tises in prose.</NOTE>Isocrates: &amp; others haue wryte~ the feactes of armes, or policies of warre, &amp; the goodly shorte saiynges of famous me~ne as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ualerius Max. a latine autoure that wrote a werk of .ix volumes whiche he en|titleed, of the saiynges and actes of noble menne.</NOTE> Ualerius Maximus, and Sextus Iu|lius<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="marg">Sextus Iu|lius Frontin&abus; wryteth also in latine .iiii. volumes, whiche he en|titleeth strate|gematu~, that is to saie of armes, or poli|cies of warre.</NOTE> Frontinus, whiche Frontinus decla|reth y^e self fame thyng by diuerse other wry|ters before hym customeably to haue been

For in the actes &amp; deedes of prin|ces, a good porcion of the laude and praise the Counsaillour maye clayme and chale~ge for geuyng his auise the Capitain for his chieualrie, &amp; the souldyours for their stoute|nesse.

As it is reported that Siramnes the Per|sian, (a Capitain as I suppose) saied, when he was asked why his deedes wer not aun|swerable to his ioyly saiynges, for because (saieth he) what I wil speake, lyeth in myne owne power, but how suche thynges as I dooe, shall ende or bee taken, standeth in the pleasure of fortune and of the kyng. Albeeit honeste purposes &amp; deuises are not therefore vtterly defeacted of their due laude and con+digne praise. But the saied Plutarchus dooeth in this kynde ferre excede and passe all other wryters, not onely in choosyng y^e best, but also in expounyng and declaryng
<PB REF="8">
y^esame. For these saiynges (whiche, as afore is mencioned, the Grekes calle~ apophtheg|mata) haue appropriated vnto theim a cer|tain reason &amp; marke of their owne whereby to iudge, so that thei dooe plainly expresse &amp; sette out the veraye naturall inclinacio~ and disposicion of eche speaker that thei procede fro~, briefly, finely, quippyngly, and meryly within the boundes of good maner. And as euerie seuerall persone hath proprely belon|gyng vnto hym a facio~ of his owne wherby he is commended, and whereby his sai|ynges &amp; dooynges haue a good grace orels other wyse: euen so like wyse hath euerie nacion, so that not one manier saiynges are conueniente for Alexander and for Philip|pus or Antigonus. One sorte are meete for Alcibiades: Again one facion agreeable for a manne of Lacedaemon, and an other for a Scythian or a Thracian: and a diuerse from y^t again comely for a manne of Athe|nes, or for a Romain. Now, in expressyng &amp; vttreyng suche saiynges Xenophon seemeth to me somewhat weeryshe, Herodotus voide of quickenesse or life, Diodorus &amp; Quintus Curtius ouer full of woordes, and so foorth of the other wryters, whiche I surceasse by name to speake of. Plutarchus is a perfecte feloe in all poinctes, and therefore I haue
<PB REF="8">
thought best thesame Plutarchus to foloe principally aboue all others. Wherefore all y^t euer is co~prised in y^e werke of this autour whiche he entitleed de apophthegmatibus, y^t is, of feacte and brief saiynges, ye shall fynd here in this werke euerie whitte of it. Wee dooe all knowe that this werke of Plutar|chus hath been twis translated out of greke into latine, first by Francisce Philelphus, and afterward again by Raphael Regius, with whom I was somewhat acquainted in the vniuersitee of Padwaye. Philelphus in diuerse places had missed y^t cushe~, whiche places Raphael dooeth restore and correcte, and yet somewhere stumbleth hymself. The truth is, thei bothe wer menne, and might erre, mystakyng a thyng y^t thei read. Albeit either of theim mynded to bee nothyng els but a plain tra~slatour of the greke into la|tine, but I for many causes haue thought better the saied Plutarchus to foloe, the~ to translate, to expoune at large, then woorde for woorde out of greke onely to enterprete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> first that the stile might bee the more clere &amp; plain as beeyng lesse bounden to the greke woordes: (For this prese~t booke of myne is not wrytte~ vnto Traianus, a ma~ne bothe in greke &amp; latine excellentely well seen, and also in lo~ge experie~ce of all manier affaires

And certes for myne owne parte, y^e geassyng and redyng what diuers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of these apophthegmes should meane or si|gnifie, hath curstely troubleed &amp; vexed my braines, &amp; I ca~not saie whether it hath some where beguyled me too. And in places not a fewe I haue had muche strougleyng &amp; wra|stleyng with the faultes of enprientyng in y^e bookes, at whiche it could not bee avoided, but that the enterpreters and translatours maugre their heddes did stumble. For it is
<PB REF="9">
a thyng vneth beleueable how muche &amp; how boldely aswell the commen writers that fro~ tyme to tyme haue copied out the bookes of Plutarchus, as also certain y^t haue thought theim selfes hable to countrolle and emend all me~nes dooynges, haue taken vpo~ theim in this autour who ought with all reuere~ce to haue been handleed of theim and with all feare to haue been preserued from altreyng deprauyng or corruptyng. For neuer hath there been emong y^e greke writers, (especialli as touchyng matiers of vertue and good be+haueour,) any one more holy then Plutar|chus, or better worthie of all menne to bee read. But the veraye same thyng hath pro|uoked persones desirous of glorie &amp; of lucre, to depraue &amp; corrupte this autour, to putte in more then he wrote, and also to leaue out of that he wrote whiche ought moste of all to haue feared theim from soo dooyng. For euerie wryter y^e better accepted and sette by that he is, and y^e greater name that he hath emong learned menne, so muche the rather shall he for lucre &amp; auauntage bee corrupted. That this autour hath been soo vsed, y^e ve|raye diuersitee of y^e Greeke texte not agree|yng one copie w^t an other dooeth right well argue and proue. For all others omitted, to speake onely of this prese~t werke that nowe

Besides this, where Plutarchus in the preface by expresse woordes dooeth plainly testifie that in the liues he had myn|gleed the saiynges and actes of noble me~ne together thone with thother: &amp; in this werke for briefnesse to haue lynked together onely their apophthegmes or saiynges, yet dooe wee see right many thynges admixt &amp; putte in emo~g y^e apophthegmes whiche in veraye dede are no saiynges at all, nor any other thyng but me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e pollices of warre which the Grekes callen Strategemata. Now in y^e self same werke one and y^esame thynges so often again and again repeated, dooen thei not openly crye this argumente and matier by some other feloe to haue been co~tamynated &amp; sloubreed? So y^t wee maye now pardone y^t in certain places an apophthegma is reci|ted vnder y^e name of the persone that it was spoken to, and not of hym by whom it was spoke~, as of Lysymachus &amp; Philippus.

that Philippus made vnto Lysimachus, is told and reported vnder the title or chapiter of Lysimachus. But yet it was an higher poincte of presumpcion y^t of one werke thei haue made it twoo. For because Plutar|chus of the saiynges of Lacedaemonians, whiche been a veraye greate noumbre, had touched onely so many as for y^e Emperour beeyng with many matiers sore embus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, semed like to suffice. He, whosoeuer it was, (at lest if it wer but one feloe &amp; no mo that sette handes therunto) hath assigned to the saiynges of Lacedaemonians one propre volume, and that accordyng to the ordre of y^e greke letters as thei stand in y^e alphabeete, whiche Raphael in his translacion hath turned into the ordre of y^e letters of y^e latine A,B.C. But this was of all the three euen the veraye wurst. For Ualerius and Fro~|tinus folowen y^e ordre of suche sentencies as thei shewe concernyng religion, concernyng affeccio~ &amp; loue to me~nes cou~trees, co~cernyng trueth in keepyng promisses made, concer|nyng mannefull hardynesse and co~cernyng <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ice, &amp; likewise of other matiers settyng <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">che of theim in his right ordre and place.

Fro~ the Lacedemonians he cometh to the The|banes, fro~ the Thebanes to the Romaines, so that the reader by the saiynges of a fewe persones maye familiarly knowe the ordre of the whole historie, whiche ordre that feloe hath pieteously confounded &amp; trobleed and sette out of ordre, that soondreed and disse|uered the saiynges of the Lacedemonians fro~ the others, &amp; yet here and there repetyng the veraye same thynges that Plutarchus had gathered afore vnto Traianus, albeit in soondrie places one thyng repeated is muche more often deprehended and openly found in the other werke of apophthegmes, but in bothe werkes so ofte~ as thesame fal|lyng in a slumbre and forgettyng hymself cannot lyghte on Plutarchus a writer of

More ouer, this parte hath no preface at all, and the preface that goeth before the apophthegmes vnto Traianus will not s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rue to bothe werkes. Now, what thanke suche persones are worthie to haue whiche dooe in this wyse slabre and defyle y^e bookes of famous autores, I will not at this tyme reason, but truely me thynketh it a veraye sacriliege. Yet of me (except a fewe saiynges of Lacedemonians, because the self same been repeated in the other table of re|hersall euerie one of theim) is not so muche as one omitted af all that goeth abrode vn|der y^e name of Plutarchus partely to the~de that the reader beeyng rather a gredie glut|ton, then a mynion deintie peece might not mysse any thyng that he would faine haue: and partely, for that I sawe nothyng there but woorthie to bee knowen, though some tyme rehersed &amp; tould out of his right place.

Of Marcus Tullius, I will nothyng saie at this pre|sente, who is of many menne thought in iestyng to haue remembred or considreed as he ought to haue dooen neither measure nor yet honestee and comelynesse.
